<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ac304b">
<p>
This is part IA of the so-called <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a> to learn programming and algorithms from scratch. The way these notes work is I do this material with you, and point out anything that may trip up a beginner. The further we go on, the more terse the notes will get because I can then assume a background. If you know how to use a web browser you can start this curriculum, no expertise in software installation, programming or any other background is assumed. This means if you only own a phone or tablet, you can still complete most of this material. 
</p>

<p>
In the AI <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/ai.html">workshop</a>, we will take another programming course introducing the language Julia, which has similar syntax to the course we take here and all this will be much easier to understand once you see it twice. In the math <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html">workshop</a> we will learn complexity theory and you will see some topics from here again to better understand them. In other words we are climbing a ladder of knowledge we aren't mastering everything as we go it will take time. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org4a34856">Outline</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4a34856">

</ul></li>

<p>
I'm going to make a type theory workshop after this one is done at the end of the year if you want to learn dependent types (software verification) and work through Robert Harper's computational higher type theory book that's not out yet.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org05ac47a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org05ac47a">Start here</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05ac47a">
<p>
We begin with Brown University's CS019 <i>Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science</i>. This is not a usual compsci class, things like log n complexity structures to hold data, infinite streams, graphs and testing are explained completely in the lectures and book. You won't be expected to understand everything the first time around, the further you get in the course the more you will understand earlier material. 
</p>

<p>
Look around the various course <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/">pages</a>, like the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/README.html">readme</a>, and the notes about the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/policy.html#(part._.Unusual_.Assignments)">unusual assignments</a> which respects the intelligence of the student. Look around the instructor's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">page</a> like his manifesto on the current state of compsci education, and scroll through his <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/">papers</a>. Skim through the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/paper.pdf">paper</a> on 'What Help Do Students Seek in TA Hours?' because it's from the exact course we are about to take. 'TA' is a teaching assistant, usually a student who did well in the course before. 
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/placement.html">placement</a> for the course but CS019 assumes no background and we have the luxury of time to fill in any blanks as we go.

<h2 id="org01feb02">Lecture 1 CS019 Pyret Demo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01feb02">
<p>
We're starting with the lecture titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0tHXI7SBjncgRrhL4DPEwDgUjUtk2_C">Wed 9-5-18</a>. Go to code.pyret.org (referred to as CPO) and click <i>open editor</i> as you follow along the lecture. The book will cover everything he's doing like what a list is, what a function is, this is just a demonstration of the online interpreter. You can run Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/set-sail/">offline</a> too. 
</p>

<p>
Notice he shuts down a lot of out of scope questions to not derail the lecture.  
</p>

<p>
@34:20 is the private app Exemplar which we don't have access to, and is usually an extra assignment on homework. The idea is that the students are given a task 'write a program that calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> of data in a list'. They start by writing the tests first before implementing the program, to get you to think about the problem. The exemplar app already has a working (and purposely buggy) implementation of the assignment that they can't see the source code for which is where the 'chaffs' are found (potential bugs caught). We will have to write a lot of tests ourselves, covering enough cases until we've fleshed out the problem enough that we can go about implementing it. The professor's university page has a paper on Exemplar detailing how many tests the students typically write which is 30+. 
</p>

<p>
So how can we figure out the student given test cases for the median program? By looking up what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> is and the procedure to find it. Reading that article we see that the median is a value that seperates a finite list of numbers, that can be found by arranging them from the smallest to the greatest. If there is an odd number of entries, the middle number that splits the list into two even parts is picked. Otherwise it is defined to be the mean of the two middle values which means add them both and divide by 2, the idea being getting as close as possible to evenly splitting the data. That's why the test for [list: 1, 3, 2] is 2 because your program would reorder the list to be [list: 1, 2, 3] and choose 2 as the median. The Fermi problems he talks about must be released on Piazza which requires campus logins, <a href="https://piazza.com/class">https://piazza.com/class</a> is a kind of wiki/msg forum for courses that encourages anonymous postings so students don't feel embarassed to ask questions. A lot of universities now solely distribute their course materials through it meaning the public doesn't have access anymore. You can find these yourself online anyway by searching for Fermi problems. 
</p>

<p>
At the end he mentions the design recipe, as a way to save TAs time, explaining if you show up to office hours for help they will go about writing a template with the student, going through all the various stages and not just giving them an answer. He notes it is totally optional to use the design recipe, but it will help you with the hard assignments and if you're going to office hours with a lot of questions clearly your methods aren't working so why not try their method. If you read that <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/">paper</a> <i>What Help Do Students Seek in TA Office Hours</i> in the beginning of this workshop you'll see statistical results of the outcomes of students who used the design recipe vs those that didn't and their final grades. 
</p>

<p>
Templates are covered in the third lecture, it's a tool to extract 'code for free' from your data and will be useful for some of the assignments.

<h3 id="org56bfb2e">Reading PAPL</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org56bfb2e">
<p>
Let's work through the <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/">book</a> <i>Programming and Programming Languages</i>, I'm using whatever the latest version is (as of this writing, 2020). This book is a work in progress so you'll see some minor errors like "REF" which is supposed to later be a link to whatever reference in the text that's not finished yet. The lectures we do will fill in these blanks.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 3 <i>Getting Started</i> read while you have CPO open (<a href="https://code.pyret.org">https://code.pyret.org</a>). The examples with many "&gt;" in front of them indicates enter this into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>, on the right hand side of the pyret code editor like he did in the lecture pressing enter to eval. It's running a read-eval-print-loop (repl) which means exactly what you think it means. It reads input, evaluates it, prints it to the console and then loops back to waiting to read input again. You can increase the font size if you click the lambda skull logo on the top left side.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6655629" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6655629">Methods</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6655629">
<p>
In the documentation for <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html">lists,</a> you will see built-in functions called methods. These have a dot notation such as .length() or .map(). What this means is the object itself, a list object, has features you can access directly. If your list is named my-list then you can access these by my-list.length() or by chaining them together, such as my-list.sort().length() to both sort and return the length of a list. Try this yourself in the REPL.
</p>

<h3 id="orgde6259c">Reading chapter 4</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgde6259c">
<p>
You spent all of the last chapter entering commands into the REPL on the right hand side of the pyret online editor, now you'll use the left hand side to write functions and run them by either pressing Ctrl-Enter or the <i>Run</i> button. If you make a mistake like accidentally deleting all your code Ctrl-z will undo. This is a good chapter telling you exactly what is evaluated and how when you click <i>run</i>. 
</p>

<p>
4.3 seems to be an error, width = 30 should create a new directory entry for width and associate it with value 30 (not value 'size'). 
</p>

<p>
4.3.1 it's worth noting when you have an include statement all the definitions in that library are added to the directory, meaning you have a very large namespace now including all of these <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/image.html">definitions</a>. Many programs you'll see in the wild try to contain this namespace by only importing select functions from libraries, or in functional languages they will import libraries only within a function body so that namespace does not exist outside of that function instead of filling the top of the program with include statements that open up an enormous globally accessed namespace.   
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org701d045" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org701d045">Reading chapter 5</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org701d045">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is a recorded recitation for this chapter <a href="https://youtu.be/kR1DvZ17mkc">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This chapter tells you exactly how functions are defined and run by Pyret. Note that he writes the examples like how the code in the body of the function would look like, such as "is 5 * 0.25" this is to help you write the function itself by first working through the examples.  
</p>

<p>
You can define a function within a function, to access the namespace/scope of the parent function:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun moon-weight(earth-weight :: Number) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "A toy example of scope" 

  fun helper():
    earth-weight * 1/6
  end

  helper()
where:
  moon-weight(1) is 1/6
  moon-weight(2) is 1/3
  moon-weight(0) is 0
end
</pre>

<p>
Here the inside helper() function can access the earth-weight value because it's within scope. This is sometimes referred to as a trampoline, upon evaluation of moon-weight() you bounce back into the function body to run some helper function. It will be helpful to know this when we do some of the cs019 assignments and you need to have multiple helper functions inside another function. 
</p>

<p>
Now that you've read this chapter, read chapter 4.4 <i>Functions as Templates</i> from this <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf">pdf</a>. He describes functions as containing 'holes that fit a pattern' you may find illuminating and parameters as placeholders. Functions are values, and the variable you declare them by such as in 4.3 'moon-weight()' are bound to that value. The math example at the end may not make sense yet but he's trying to show that a function is a value, and using the Pyret example in 5.3 for moon weight, try in the REPL moon-weight(moon-weight(10)) to see how a function evaluates to a value to be used by another function.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5ae09c0">
<p>
Watch the Mon9/10/18 second lecture. Interesting lecture about the rainfall problem and the benefits of writing a lot of examples in order to understand badly defined problems. Data science/machine learning is brought up, as examples of dirty data. Higher-order functions are talked about, like filter and map which are in the pyret documentation. We're going to write our own versions of map, filter and fold after we cover chapter 10 <i>Processing Lists</i>.

Tabular data, and what normalizing data means. Remember the rainfall lecture. You don't have to do this chapter but it will help to know about tabular data like the user interface in gmail. 
</p>

<p>
In the previous versions of PAPL, he noted why they composed these table row operations to be independent of each other so combining them in complex expressions is possible just like <a href="https://youtu.be/6VCHuLqfmV8">SQL</a>. Where does tabular data often appear? Excel spreadsheets that every trader <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15819016">still uses</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgca5efbb">
<p>
A <a href="https://youtu.be/XEOLa6J2_F0">tutorial</a> on lists, case syntax and recursion, will be helpful when reading chapter 9 and 10. Recursion will be best understood once we do recurrence relations. For a list, imagine you are building up a structure one link at a time: link(1, link(2, link(3, &#x2026; and now you want to take apart that structure, so you use recursion to disassemble the structure you built back to the base case. 
</p>

<p>
PAPL has a <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/Recursive_Data.html">chapter</a> on this you can skip ahead and read now to see what a template for recursion on lists looks like.

<p>
If during an assignment you get stuck come back to this chapter and you will certainly find what you're looking for. I highly recommend doing all the exercises here and understanding everything in fact I would re-read these chapters until you can effortlessly do all the examples and understand exactly how they work, then you're at a point where the rest of the lectures will make sense without having to stop and figure out all steps. There's a silly story about Gordon Ramsay as a junior chef practicing how to make lobster ravioli with a small frozen potato and pasta over 90x after his shift until the restaurant he was at would let him try it on real lobster. He also had to practice slicing a mackerel a few hundred times until they would let him near the more expensive fish. This is what we are doing, practice.

<p>
10.1 type all those examples in the REPL to see what they do, like manually linking a list together with the contructor link(link(empty)) which allows you append things on to lists without using a built-in like .append() or the "+" operator. The book walks through each exercise in 10.2 in the rest of the chapter by constructing examples of the behavior of the function.

  my-pos-nums([list: 1,  0]) is link(1, my-pos-nums([list:  ]))
  my-pos-nums([list: 1,  1]) is link(1, my-pos-nums([list: 1]))

  # direct test of expected output

Read 10.6 how my-avg() was obtained. Here we are shown helper functions inside other functions with the statement: <i>Observe that we do not change my-running-sum itself to take extra arguments. There are multiple reasons for this</i>. One reason is you want simple documentation, user intuitive and bug-free access to my-alternating() just like a typical command shell utility like change directory (cd) you wouldn't have users init your accumulators with cd(empty, 0, dir-name) you would instead want a simple interface where all internal operations are encapsulated that only takes a single input.

In 10.8.4 to reduce the computation they store the list that uniq-rec(r) outputs and if f is not a member, link it to all of the list ur or else return ur, so you save one iteration of the entire list by having f only compare against a distinct list with all duplicates removed.

<h2 id="org5be5804">Lecture 3 CS019 Insertion Sort</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5be5804">
<p>
We're watching Wed9/12/18 lecture on sorting. These videos you can download in 1920x1080 if you want and zoom if you can't see the writing on the whiteboard. 
</p>

<p>
He walks through exactly what a template is and how to extract data to make a template, and spends the rest of the class writing insertion sort using only what we already know so far. You have to hand step through it a little to understand what insertion sort is doing. Function sort() is calling insert() with insert(f, sort(r)) it isn't calling insert(f, r). 
</p>

<p>
Let's step the evaluation by hand with [list: 0, 1, 3, 2] being input to sort(). The following calls to insert happen:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(0,(insert(1,(insert(3,(insert(2, [list: empty])))))))</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's like our example with my-len() with 1 + 1 + etc. Evaluation starts at the deepest inner bracket:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(2, [list: empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is list empty? link(2, link(empty))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(3, [list: 2, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 3 &lt; 2?</li>
<li>link(2, insert(3, [list: empty]))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 1 &lt; 2?</li>
<li>then it must the smallest in the entire list:</li>
<li>link(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 0 &lt; 1?</li>
<li>link(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 0, 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>no more delayed computations, sort() is finished</li>
</ul>

<p>
The returns to sort():
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(0,(insert(1,(insert(3, [list: 2, empty])))))</li>
<li>insert(0,(insert(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])))</li>
<li>insert(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everytime a list is returned, the next call to insert can happen because it is complete with insert(n, list).
</p>

<h3 id="org4458571">Lab: Higher-Order Functions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4458571">
<p>
Let's do the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2016/hofs-lab.pdf">lab</a> on functions as data, and write our own map, filter and fold. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun fun-plus-one(num :: Number, func :: (Number -&gt; Number)) -&gt; Number:
  func(num) + 1
end

&gt;&gt;fun-plus-one(16, num-sqr)
&gt;&gt;5
</pre>

<p>
Try entering various built-ins, or one you wrote yourself, as the second parameter to fun-plus-one.
</p>

<p>
<b>Map</b>
</p>

<p>
We're given test cases and asked to implement f-to-c and goldilocks, and given the formula for f to c temperature unit conversion.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun f-to-c(f-lst :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
  cases (List) f-lst:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt; 
      link((f - 32) * (5/9), f-to-c(r))
  end
end

fun goldilocks(f-lst :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  cases (List) f-lst:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if f &gt; 90:
        link("too hot", goldilocks(r))
      else if f &lt; 70:
        link("too cold", goldilocks(r))
      else:
        link("just right", goldilocks(r))
      end
  end
end
check:
  f-to-c([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: 55, 25, 20]
  goldilocks([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
We're asked to rewrite goldilocks using map. The data dumped into a map function is whatever the value is at that list index. In this case we know it's a number since f-lst parameter is :: List&lt;Number&gt;.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun goldilocks2(f-lst :: List&lt; Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  f-lst.map({(x): if x &gt; 90: "too hot" else if x &lt; 70: "too cold" else: "just right" end})
end
check:
  goldilocks2([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
.map() is a built-in method on a list, where f-lst.map() means we are mapping over f-lst. I used the shorthand syntax for lambdas.
</p>

<p>
We could have also rewritten it like the following example, where a seperate function is used for map instead of writing our own lambda:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun goldilocks(x :: Number) -&gt; String:
  if x &gt; 90:
    "too hot"
  else if x &lt; 70:
    "too cold"
  else:
    "just right"
  end
end

fun goldilocks2(f-lst :: List&lt; Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  map(goldilocks, f-lst)
end
check:
  goldilocks2([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
Now our task is write our own version of map(). I used the documentation examples for map as check tests. Remember map consumes a function and a list, applies the function to each entry in the list returning a new list, try to do this yourself before looking at a solution (your solution may be better). For annotations, I used the <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/s_annotations.html#(part._s~3aname-ann)">built-in</a> name annotations but if you read through the documentation you can also import annotations, or create your own datatype. The 'T' annotation is described at the end of chapter on processing lists, the notation &lt;T&gt; says that T is a type variable parameter meaning it can be any type, so if you give map a list of numbers it will be that type, or a list of strings, it will be List&lt;String&gt; etc.

<pre class="example">
fun my-map&lt;T&gt;(func :: (T -&gt; T), l :: List&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;T&gt;:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      link(func(f), my-map(func, r))
  end
end
check:
  my-map(num-tostring, [list: 1, 2]) is [list: "1", "2"]
  my-map(lam(x): x + 1 end, [list: 1, 2]) is [list: 2, 3]
end
</pre>

<p>
<b>Filter</b>
</p>

<p>
First two assignments are straight forward to get you to used to using filter, except you have to use string-to-code-points() instead of any built-in string functions. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun tl-dr(lol :: List&lt;String&gt;, length-thresh :: Number) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  filter(lam(element): string-to-code-points(element).length() &lt;= length-thresh end, lol)
end
check:
  tl-dr([list: "dkfjdkj", "hi", "dkfjk"], 2) is [list: "hi"]
  tl-dr([list: "corner", "case", ""], 2) is [list: ""]
  tl-dr([list: "a", "b", "c"], 0) is empty
end

fun eliminate-e(words :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  doc: "I got 101 and 69 from string-to-code-points(e) or (E)"
  filter(lam(element): if string-to-code-points(element).member(101) or
    string-to-code-points(element).member(69): false else: true end end, words)
end
check:
  eliminate-e([list: "e"]) is empty
  eliminate-e([list: "there's", "no", "letter", "e", "here"]) is [list: "no"]
  eliminate-e([list: "hEy", "101e"]) is empty
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
Lambda parameters can be a single letter: filter(lam(x): x &gt; 1 end) as it's immediately evident what that parameter is and it's scope is limited. Task: implement our own version of filter, which is similar to what we did for map:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun my-filter&lt;T&gt;(func :: ( T -&gt; Boolean), l :: List&lt;T&gt;)-&gt; List&lt;T&gt;:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if func(f):
        link(f, my-filter(func, r))
      else:
        my-filter(func, r)
      end
  end
end
check:
  fun length-is-one(s :: String) -&gt; Boolean:
    string-length(s) == 1
  end
  my-filter(length-is-one, [list: "ab", "a", "", "c"]) is [list: "a", "c"]
  my-filter(is-link, [list: empty, link(1, empty), empty]) is [list: link(1, empty)]
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
<b>Fold</b>
</p>

<p>
Try the two tasks: list-product and list-max:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">

fun list-product(lon :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  fold(lam(acc, n): acc * n end, 1, lon)
end
check:
  list-product([list: 2, 2, 2]) is 8
  list-product([list: 0, 1, 2]) is 0
  list-product([list: -1, -1]) is 1
end

fun list-max(lon :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  fold(lam(acc, n): if ((acc == "start") or (n &gt; acc)): n else: acc end end, "start", lon)
end
check:
  list-max([list: -1, 1, 2]) is 2
  list-max([list: 0, -100, 1]) is 1
  list-max([list: 1/2, 3/4]) is 3/4
  list-max([list: -1, -2, -3]) is -1
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
Write your own fold 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun my-fold&lt;T&gt;(func :: (T, T-&gt; T), acc :: T, l :: List&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; T:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; acc
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      my-fold(func, func(acc, f), r)
  end
end
check:
  my-fold((lam(acc, elt): acc + elt end), 0, [list: 3, 2, 1]) is 6
  my-fold((lam(acc, elt): acc + elt end), 10, [list: 3, 2, 1]) is 16
  fun combine(acc, elt) -&gt; String:
    tostring(elt) + " - " + acc
  end
  my-fold(combine, "END", [list: 3, 2, 1]) is "1 - 2 - 3 - END"
  my-fold(combine, "END", empty) is "END"
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
<b>Map2</b>
</p>

<p>
Try the task for implementing who-passed, the second task we're asked to write map2 ourselves. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
# link(ff, rr) and link(f, r) can be called anything:
# ie: link(head-first, tail-first) or link(head-second, tail-second)

fun my-map2&lt;T&gt;(func :: (T, T -&gt; T), list1 :: List&lt;T&gt;, list2 :: List&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;T&gt;:
  cases (List) list1:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      cases (List) list2:
        | empty =&gt; empty
        | link(ff, rr) =&gt;
          link(func(f, ff), my-map2(func, r, rr))
      end
  end
end
check:
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune", "practice"])
    is [list: "misfortune", "malpractice"]
  my-map2(_ + _, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune", "practice"])
    is [list: "misfortune", "malpractice"]
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune"])
    is [list: "misfortune"]
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], empty)
    is empty
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
The last task, best-price, look on youtube what a basic demand function is. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun demand(price-increase :: Number) -&gt; Number:
 doc: "1000 is approx demand of product at a fixed price"
  1000 - (60 * price-increase)
end
</pre>

<p>
This means as the price increases, the quantity demanded will decrease by 60 units times the price increase, so if the price increase is 1, the demand is 1000 - 60. Your best-price function can take a list of price increases, the demand function, then map over the price list w/the demand function, to get a new list of adjusted demand vs price increase. Map over the adjusted demand with the price list to produce the forecast revenue, which is price * qty demanded. Then figure out how to use a combo of filter/fold in order to return the optimal price increase.
</p>

<p>
<b>Map vs Filter vs Foldl vs Foldr</b>
</p>

<p>
map and filter only consider one item at a time whereas fold can consider the entire list. You can implement both map and filter with fold (try it). If you've noticed in the Pyret documentation there is two folds: foldl and foldr:
</p>

<pre class="example">
import lists as L

L.foldl(lam(acc, x): acc + x end, 0, [list: 1, 2, 3])
# (((0 + 1)+ 2)+ 3)
# eval nested brackets first, left to right

L.foldr(lam(acc, x): acc + x end, 0, [list: 1, 2, 3])
# (1 +(2 +(3 + 0)))
# eval nested brackets right to left
</pre>

It may be helpful to look at some pdfs on software <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5150/2019sp/lectures.html#D">requirements</a>, ie: what is it we are actually building. There's many of these kinds of <a href="https://cmu-313.github.io/?#schedule">development foundations</a> style courses around that are worth looking through to better understand how to read requirements, or if you're just curious about modern methologies in building software.

Let's try the first <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/docdiffdocdiff.html">assignment</a>. 
</p>

<p>
This assignment looks difficult on purpose but it's implementation is not. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition">dot product</a> algebraic definition, look at the example for [1,3,-5] x [4,-2,-1]. Each index in the first list is multiplied by it's corresponding index in the second list, then those results are added together. To read the sigma notation, a*b = the sum of \(a_ib_i\) starting at index 1 (first element of the list) up to the length of the list (n):
</p>

<details>
<p>
If a = [1, 3, -5] and b = [4, -2, -1]:
</p>

<p>
\(a*b = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_ib_i\) = (\(1_{a1} * 4_{b1})+(3_{a2} * -2_{b2})+(-5_{a3} * -1_{b3})\)
</p>
</details>

<p>
Some more requirements are listed, such as ignoring the case (upper/lower) of a word when counting it's number of occurrences, this translates to converting list string inputs to string-to-lower/string-to-upper. The exact equation for overlap is given: dot-product(doc-vec1, doc-vec2) / num-max(num-sqr(magnitude(doc1)), num-sqr(magnitude(doc2))). The magnitude is defined as: num-sqrt(x * x) so the square root of a vector multiplied (dot product multiplication) by itself.

<div id="outline-container-org3f3a391" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3f3a391">Where to Start</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3f3a391">
<p>
One strategy is to begin with function skeletons of things you know you will need:
</p>

<pre class="example">
import lists as L

fun overlap(doc1 :: List&lt;String&gt;, doc2 :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  ```Consumes two lists of strings, ignores case, and returns their overlap: 
  dot-product(doc-vec1, doc-vec2) / num-max(num-sqr(magnitude(doc-vec1)), num-sqr(magnitude(doc-vec2)```

  fun create-vec(l-a :: List&lt;String&gt;, l-b :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes two lists and returns a vector representation of the first input (l-a)"
  end

  fun ignore-case(l-c :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
    doc: "Converts a list of words to lower case"
  end

  fun dot-product(v-a :: List&lt;Number&gt;, v-b :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes two vector lists and returns the dot product "
  end

  fun magnitude(v-c :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes a vector and returns it's magnitude: sqrt(dot-product(v-c, v-c)"
  end

end
</pre>

<p>
This function documentation is temporary to help remember what we're writing.  We will probably add more helper functions inside overlap() as we go. Let's start with create-vec() since we were given examples in the assignment writeup:
</p>

<pre class="example">
  fun create-vec(l-a :: List&lt;String&gt;, l-b :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes two lists and returns a vector representation of the first input (l-a)"
  where:
   create-vec([list: "a", "B", "c"], [list: "d", "d", "d", "b"]) is [list: 1, 1, 1, 0] 
   create-vec([list: "d", "d", "D", "b"], [list: "a", "b", "c"]) is [list: 0, 1, 0, 3]
end
  end
</pre>

<p>
We need to combine input l-a and l-b into one sorted distinct list so from our two examples: [list: "a", "b", "c", "d"]. The list library built-ins are permitted:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun create-vec(l-a :: List&lt;String&gt;, l-b :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes two lists of strings and returns a document vector representation of the first input l-a"
    distinct = L.distinct(l-a + l-b).sort()
  where:
   create-vec([list: "a", "B", "c"], [list: "d", "d", "d", "b"]) is [list: 1, 1, 1, 0] 
   create-vec([list: "d", "d", "D", "b"], [list: "a", "b", "c"]) is [list: 0, 1, 0, 3]
  # vector is ['another', list', 'of', 'words']
   create-vec([list: "list", "of", "words"], [list: "another", "list"]) is [list: 0, 1, 1, 1]
   create-vec([list: "another", "list"], [list: "list", "of", "words"]) is [list: 1, 1, 0, 0]
end
  end
</pre>

<p>
Note in the examples, the vector returned is the same length of the distinct list of each document, so this distinct list we will want to go through each element, and count how many occurrences of that word, linking the count. We can write some more helper functions for this, first function deconstructs the distinct-list into elements, each time asking something like 'if f is a member, then link(count(f))' with count() being our other helper function that takes an element as input, and counts how many times it occurs in a list. This is known as 'wishing for functions' where you pretend you already have functions to do whatever your want, and call to them as you're writing another function. Each time you wish for one write an empty template. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun create-vec(l-a :: List&lt;String&gt;, l-b :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
  doc: "Consumes two lists and returns a document vector representation of the first (l-a)"

  fun count(s :: String, l-e :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; Number:
    doc: "Counts the occurrences of a string in a document"
    cases (List) l-e:
      | empty =&gt; 0
      | link(f, r) =&gt;
        if s == f:
          1 + count(s, r)
        else:
          count(s, r)
        end
    end
  where:
    count("d", [list: "d", "b","d"]) is 2
    count("e", [list: "f"]) is 0
    count("f", empty) is 0
  end

  fun helper(distinct-list :: List&lt;String&gt;, document :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
    doc: "Helper to assemble the vector"
    cases (List) distinct-list:
      | empty =&gt; empty
      | link(f, r) =&gt; if document.member(f):
          link(count(f, document), helper(r, document))
        else:
          link(0, helper(r, document))
        end
    end
  end

  distinct = L.distinct(l-a + l-b).sort()
  helper(ignore-case(distinct), ignore-case(l-a))
where:
  create-vec([list: "a", "B", "c"], [list: "d", "d", "d", "b"]) is [list: 1, 1, 1, 0] 
  create-vec([list: "d", "d", "D", "b"], [list: "a", "b", "c"]) is [list: 0, 1, 0, 3]
end
</pre>

<p>
I wished for another function: ignore-case that I assume goes through a list of strings and converts them all to the same case. Repeat this for the rest of the assignment, see chapter 6 of PAPL to write dot-product(list1, list2) with cases of list1, cases on lists2, and link(f * ff, dot-product(r, rr)), on the empty case return the sum. When you're done click the arrow on the online interpreter and choose to type check and run.

Watching the Fri 9/14/18 lecture on performance. The setup in the beginning of the lecture is to distinguish the notation in O(n) as being a function that maps from n -&gt; steps to complete computation.

The constant mentioned at the end of the lecture in the formal notation is further exampled <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/Tools_and_Techniques.html#(part._.A_formal_definition)">here</a>. It's an estimation constant that bounds f, so no matter what input to f(k), a constant c times g(k) will be bigger or equal to it. What times g(k) is bigger or equal to f(k) -&gt; 5k + 4:

<p>
We're reading <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2019/predicting-growth.html">Predicting Growth</a> following the last cs019 lecture on complexity. 
</p>

<p>
17.5 <i>structural recursion</i> can be described as you have built up a structure like say a list, adding n + 1 elements and structural recursion is taking that structure apart in the same way you built it up, recurring on (n - 1) like counting it's length, whereas <i>generative</i> recursion rearranges a problem into a set of new generated problems, basically recursion that <a href="https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_five.html">ignores structure</a>. Quick sort is an example of generative recursion you break on a pivot and now have 2 lists plus the pivot, that's not how you assembled that list structurally. 
</p>

<p>
The Tabular Method, is not necessary as you will read in 17.8 since we can hand count these functions like we learned in the lecture. The 'question' refers to the conditionals in the cases statement like empty? and the answer is what that datatype variant evaluates to, like empty, or 0 or the recursive call in link(f, r). 
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let's consider the first row. The question costs three units (one each to evaluate the implicit empty-ness predicate, l, and to apply the former to the latter)</i>" which is a very difficult way of saying: calling the function is +1 cost, opening up l for cases is +1, considering empty variant is +1, so 3 in total and once more if the list is actually empty which you should remember from lecture 4 Fri/9/14/18. Second row cost calculation is different from the lecture (none of these tiny costs matter of course), We get to link(f, r) and count: link +1, f + 1, rest + 1, 2 more for the addition operation, and one more to call len() again, so total 6 for the 'answer' though the lecture we saw is +1 for link, +1 for addition, and plus (k - 1), so in the lecture len() is total 5k + 4, here it's 12k + 4. You can do either this tabular method or you can do the adhoc assign + 1 cost to anything that looks like an operations that we did in the lecture and you will end up with O([k -&gt; k]) anyway since we don't care about constants. 
</p>

<p>
17.7 We've seen this notation in lectures, they are lambda functions to remove ambiguities of math notation. 14.8 recall from lectures that in english reads: 'there exists some constant C, for all inputs n in the set of Natural Numbers to the function f(n) such that f(n) is less or equal to this same constant C multiplied by some other function g(n) implying that f() is bounded by g(). 
</p>

<p>
17.8 Let's find the smallest constant for 13k + 4 \(\le\) ck<sup>2</sup>. If k = 1 then c needs to be 17 or larger. If k = 2 then we have 30 \(\le\) 17(2<sup>2</sup>) which is true, and also true for k = 3, k = 4, if k = a trillion then 13(1 trillion) + 4 is still less than 17(1 trilllion * 1 trillion) in fact for inputs bigger than 13 the constant c becomes irrelevant. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/big-big-theta-notation">Big theta</a> is then discussed briefly as the family of functions that grow at the same speed up to a constant. Reading PAPL, if you want to understand the math notation right click it, or if on a phone press the notation, in most browsers you should get a menu popping up from MathJax to show the TeX code to see exactly what it is. 
</p>

<p>
17.9 <i>Combining Big-oh Without Woe</i> as we saw in 15-122 two functions in O(n) run consecutively (one after the other) are O(n + n) or O(2n) which is O(n) since constants don't matter, like f(5k + 4) is really f(k). A function f(n) that invokes z(n) in each of it's steps is O(n x n) or O(n<sup>2</sup>).

The first recurrence example of T(k) = T(k - 1) think of the lecture when we went through length(), which was a constant amount of 5 steps per input, plus everything that came before it, so 5 + (k-1) + 4 with the + 4 being the empty case, that's the same as T(k - 1) + c. The notation T(k - 2), T(k - 3) is referring to the next steps down the recursion tree towards the base case. Here \(c_0\) or \(c_1\) are used to show the base case is either 0 or 1 (the empty/stop recursion case). If you want go through this set of YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw/search?query=recurrence">examples</a> on recurrence relations to see what a recursion tree looks like.  
</p>

<p>
The next recurrence is T(k-1) plus k, not a constant. To understand the notation: \(T(0) + (k-(k-1)) + (k-(k-2)) + \cdots + (k-2) + (k-1) + k\) plug in a value for k:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(4) = T(0) + T(4-(4-1)) + T(4-(4-2)) + T(4-1) + T(4)</li>
<li>0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4</li>
<li>4(4+1)/2 = 10 is the closed form solution and is in O(\(n^2\)) since n(n + 1)/2 = (n<sup>2</sup> + n)/2.</li>
</ul>

<p>
2T notation means there are two recursive calls. The last recurrence relation is detailed in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvcqtZk2mng">YouTube</a> example.    
</p>

<p>
There's an induction exercise which you can try if you've followed the math workshop with this one: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(n) = n(n + 1)/2</li>
<li>Base Case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(1) = 1(1 + 1)/2 or 2/2</li>
<li>T(1) = 1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypothesis:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that T(n) = n(n + 1)/2 (assumption)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then it is true for n + 1:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(n) + (n + 1) = (n + 1)((n + 1) + 1)/2</li>
<li>T(n) + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Left side is in the form of hypothesis T(n):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n(n + 1)/2 + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let's get rid of the denominator 2 by multiplying both sides by 2/1 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n(n + 1) + 2(n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)</li>
<li>\(n^2\) + 3n + 2 = (n + 1)(n + 2)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factor left side:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(n + 1)(n + 2) = (n + 1)(n + 2)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

We will come back to this chapter after next lecture to figure out the [k -&gt; log k] and other logarithmic time algorithms.

<h2 id="orgb8a0433">Lecture 5 CS019 Insertion Sort Reccurrence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8a0433">
<p>
We're watching the Mon9/17/18 lecture. The first 30mins or so of the recording doesn't have video, but you can pause the video around 30:14 in, open the video again to hear the audio, and see everything on the board they are working on (sort and insert). He starts out talking about the invariant of insert, that it's length should always be k+1 because it is inserting a new value. The second topic is about how the size argument of a list doesn't help you with incorrect types, if you have [list: [list: empty]], that's still size = 1 even though it's empty. 
</p>

<p>
The if-statement you take the worst complexity branch, assuming worse-case analysis. The actual cost analysis of insert() starts around 20mins in because you want to resolve the dependencies of sort() by figuring out the complexity class of insert() first. A link operation link(f, r) takes a constant amount of time regardless of the size of the input list, because it doesn't make a copy of the list. The if statement is 1 + (worst case branch). 
</p>

<p>
On the right hand of the board:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tinsert(0) = \(c0\) (constant steps for empty, or base case)</li>
<li>Tinsert(k) = c + Tinsert(k - 1)</li>
<li>= c + c + c + &#x2026; \(c0\)</li>
<li>= T(k) = kc + \(c0\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember we're calling insert(f, sort(r)) on the rest of the list, so it's k - 1. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tsort(0) = \(c_0\) or a constant amount of steps</li>
<li>Tsort(k) = Tsort(k - 1) + Tinsert(k - 1)c + \(c_0\)</li>
<li>= Tsort(k - 1) + kc</li>
<li>We've seen this already, T(k - 1) + k is the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4+&#x2026;+(k - 1) + k or n(n + 1)/2 or \(O(n^2)\)</li>
<li>Insertion Sort is \(O(n^2)\) worst case, and O(n) + O(1) in the best case because you still have to call sort(r) and do linear work exploding that n sized list out before you can do the O(1) operation by insert that appends to the beginning of the list and returns.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgfd4b1e6">More Recurrences</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfd4b1e6">
<p>
Before we look at the big-O lab let's learn some more about recurrences so we 'can feel them in our bones' as suggested by Prof K in the last lecture. I'm going to use Part V <i>Recurrences</i> from MIT's <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf">Mathematics for Computer Science(mcs)</a> free book, starting on page 993 and read only up to page 1001 as cs019 will cover the analysis later (Akra-Bazzi formula/asymptotic solution) in future lectures. For now we're going to read the intro of the Tower of Hanoi, and the steps they do to solve the recurrence for merge sort. 
</p>

<p>
There are <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-14-divide-and-conquer-recurrences/">lectures</a> for the recurrence chapter of mcs, the inductive proof in the recorded lecture for the Tower of Hanoi recurrence is slightly different than the pdf:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Our original recurrence: \(T_n\) = 2\(T_{n-1}\) + 1</li>
<li>Inductive Hypothesis(IH)/closed form solution: \(T_n\) = \(2^n\) - 1</li>
<li>Base Case: \(T_1\) = \(2^1\) - 1</li>
<li>Inductive step: \(T_{n+1}\) = 2\(T_{(n-1) + (n+1)}\) + 1 or 2\(T_n\) + 1</li>
<li>"Suppose \(T_n\) = \(2^n\) - 1. Then the successor of \(T_n\) is \(T_{n+1}\) = \(2^{n+1}\) - 1"</li>
<li>Now via substitution plug in our inductive hypothesis, since we declared \(T_n\) = \(2^n\) - 1 wherever you see \(T_n\) insert that hypothesis:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(T_{n+1}\) = 2\(T_n\) + 1</li>
<li>\(T_{n+1}\) = 2(\(2^n\) - 1) + 1 (substitution)</li>
<li>\(T_{n+1}\) = \(2^{n+1}\) - 2 + 1 (distributive law)</li>
<li>\(T_{n+1}\) = \(2^{n+1}\) - 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
In mcs (the pdf text), for their IH they assumed that \(T_{n-1}\) = \(2^{n-1}\) - 1, so instead of substituting for \(T_n\) they substituted \(T_{n-1}\):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Original recurrence: \(T_n\) = 2\(T_{n-1}\) + 1</li>
<li>Assume/IH: \(T_{n-1}\) = \(2^{n-1}\) - 1</li>
<li>Inductive step (looking at the left side) from \(T_{n-1}\) to \(T_{n++}\) becomes \(T_n\), and we already know the value: \(T_n\) = 2\(T_{n-1}\) + 1</li>
<li>By substitution replace all occurrences of \(T_{n-1}\) with IH:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(T_n\) = 2(\(2^{n-1}\) - 1) + 1</li>
<li>\(T_n\) = \(2^n\) - 2 + 1</li>
<li>\(T_n\) = \(2^n\) - 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
In <i>Merge Sort</i>, \(T_n\) describes two recursive calls, with the total input divided in half between them, plus another recursive call to compare each list and produce the smaller value (merging). The plug and chug method they use is self explanatory until Step 3 where they introduce k = log n in order to get their base case of \(T_1\) = 0. When you see \(2^k\) anywhere in the recurrence replace it with \(2^{\log n}\) which is n because \(a^{\log b}\) = \(b\). What you should take away from step 3 is how they manipulate the recurrence in order to produce a known value of \(T_n\) such as \(T_0\) or \(T_1\) in this case.
</p>


<p>
Step 3, after k = log n has been substituted for all k:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(2^{\log n}T_{n/2^{\log n}}\) + log n * n - \(2^{\log n}\) + 1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Remember \(2^{\log n}\) = n</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n\(T_{n/n}\) + n * log n - n + 1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n\(T_{n/n}\) is n\(T_1\) and in step 3 \(T_1\) was already declared to be 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n(0) + n * log n - n + 1</li>
<li>n log n - n + 1 or \(T_n \in O(n \log n)\)</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org27e2e36" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org27e2e36">Return to 17.10 Recurrences</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org27e2e36">
<p>
Let's go back and <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2019/predicting-growth.html">read</a> 14.10 <i>Solving Recurrences</i> again now that we know how logarithms are used to produce a known base case value, like \(T_1\). The first is T(k) = T(k/2) + c or [k -&gt; log k] recurrence, we are looking at binary search. For this binary search example, note the trick to make this recurrence \(T_1\) and look up how the logarithms are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#Definition">defined</a> for \(log_2\) k. 
</p>

<p>
The next example T(k) = T(k/2) + k or [k -&gt; k], again they have used the \(2^{\log k}\) trick to produce k/k, and they have also used the distributive property to factor out k producing k(1/k + &#x2026;+ 1/4 + 1/2 + 1) which ends up simplifying to base case 1 constant + 2k. The [k -&gt; k log k] example they get rid of \(2^k\) by replacing it with \(2^{\log k}\) which is k and this is multiplied by T(1) which is \(c_1\). The rest of the recurrence is k \(\log_2\) k which is exampled and explained in this article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#Product,_quotient,_power,_and_root">power rule</a>. \(\log_2 k^k\) is k \(\cdot\) \(log_2\) k or k.

<div id="outline-container-orgf6cc1bf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf6cc1bf">Lab: Big-O 1</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf6cc1bf">
<p>
Let's go through the lab <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2016/bigO-lab.pdf">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
First task, why can we disregard constants, we already know why, because g(x) = 5x<sup>2</sup> + x is T(k) = T(k-1) + n which is O[k -&gt; k<sup>2</sup>]), since we only care (in this class anyway) about finding an upper bound for the worse case, we don't care about the constant 5 or x as they are both bound by x<sup>2</sup>. We've seen how when inputs grow large, x<sup>2</sup> grows so much that x and any constants are insignificant numbers (solely for worse case analysis of course).  
</p>

<p>
Second task in the chapter <i>Notation</i> notice the brackets are needed if using the [k -&gt; k] notation and is why the first example of O(w -&gt; w<sup>3</sup>) is wrong, it should be f \(\in\) O([w -&gt; w<sup>3</sup>]). There also shouldn't be any constants in the notation like [m -&gt; 3m]. The example of f \(\in\) O(h<sup>2</sup>) should likely be f \(\in\) O([h -&gt; h<sup>2</sup>]) or f(h) \(\in\) O(h<sup>2</sup>). 
</p>

<p>
In 3 <i>The Tabular Method</i> we finally get an explanation what the terms 'question' and 'answer' mean, this should probably be in the book. The second row of the cases statement we already read in the book for len function, and saw it in lectures. It really doesn't matter how you count the constant units either for worse case analysis, in lectures we chose link(f, r) as +1 cost, the addition as +1 cost, and added it to 3k + 4 so total 5k + 4. If you carefully counted each operation in link and came up with 100k + 4 it'd still be the same worst case analysis of len() is in O([k -&gt; k]). Looking back at chapter <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2018/predicting-growth.html#(part._solving-recurrences)">14</a> T(k) = T(k - 1) + c recurrence is the same as len(). 
</p>


<p>
4 <i>Big-O with less math</i> explains how to estimate complexity a little more clearly than the book does. Task:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1: This could be [k -&gt; k * log k] because for each element we make a call to another function so O(F X G). This also fits the explanation of f(x) = x log x where the recursive call is logarithmic but input stays the same.</li>
<li>2: This could be [n -&gt; n + m] which is [n -&gt; n]</li>
<li>3: This could be [k -&gt; k * m<sup>2</sup>] which is [k -&gt; k<sup>3</sup>]</li>
<li>4: This is 'a function makes calls to another function at every one of it's steps' so O(F X G) as we are linearly going through to-delete, and at each element f, we call remove(f) on another list (remove(f) then needs to linearly go through all of l to remove f).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's figure out 5, a function that takes input 2 lists and counts their length. This translates to two nested cases:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun dbl-count(list1, list2):
 cases (List) list1:
  | empty =&gt; 0
  | link(f, r) =&gt;
 cases (List) list2:
  | empty =&gt; 0
  | link(ff, rr) =&gt; 1 + dbl-count(r) + 1 + dbl-count(rr)
  end
 end
end   
</pre>

<p>
Looking at chapter 17 in the book, this is T(k) = 2T(k - 1) + c. Two recursive calls each doing a constant amount of work. Let's confirm by watching <a href="https://youtu.be/JvcqtZk2mng">T(n)=2T(n-1)+1</a>. Indeed this is O([k -&gt; k<sup>k</sup>]).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>6: My guess is that this is O(F(k) X G(k) X H(k<sup>2</sup>)) or O([k -&gt; k<sup>4</sup>])</li>
<li>7: Recall from lectures that you figure out complexity cost of dependent functions from the function dependencies up, so we want to find the cost for rem-helper() first. It takes a size k input, and an element from rem-dups. We have an if-branch so we take the worst branch, and both branches involve going linearly through the entire list and looking at every element. We'll just naively calculate some costs: We go into the function, +1, we open the list, +1, we look at empty case, +1, it is empty and we return empty so 3k + 1. If it's not empty +1 for link operation, +1 to compare f to c, and worst case I guess is +1 to link f then + all the previous operations all over again until empty. So this is k + constant or O([k -&gt; k]). Let's look at rem-dups. It's doing linear work up until it calls rem-helper() on every single element. The definition of Quadratic: 'appears when comparing each element of a data structure to all other elements in that structure'  seems to fit this situation, so O([k -&gt; k<sup>2</sup>]). Looking in the book, we see T(k) = T(k - 1) + k describes this program as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
5.1 Recall \(c_0\) represents the base case T(0) which is some constant amount of work. 
</p>

<p>
Another task, find the closed form of T(k-2) + 1 if k &gt; 1. I will show the improper guess method where you input values for T(n) and  hope an obvious pattern reveals itself, then link the correct method:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(0) = constant</li>
<li>T(1) = constant</li>
<li>T(2) = T(0) + 1 or 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(3) = T(1) + 1 or 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(4) = T(2) + 1 or 1 + 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(5) = T(3) + 1 or 1 + 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(6) = T(4) + 1 or 1 + 1 + 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(7) = T(5) + 1 or 1 + 1 + 1 + constant</li>
<li>T(8) = T(6) + 1 or 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + constant</li>
<li>Pattern: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4 etc. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hint: Enter the pattern into OEIS and you find <a href="https://oeis.org/A004526">this</a></li>
<li>floor(n/2) (integer division, no remainder)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>T(n) = floor(n/2) + constant for n &gt; 1</li>
<li>This is [n -&gt; log n] since at each level we only do constant work and throw away half the input.</li>
<li>For a better explanation, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gt0D0IqU5w">this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Second recurrence relation: 2T(k-1) + 1 for k &gt; 0 we already did, it's O([k -&gt; k<sup>k</sup>]). The extra challenge relations are all in the book and lectures to solve these exist in this guy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O">playlist</a> under 2.1.1 - 2.3.3.

If you use imp2020s you get the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/schedule.shtml">whole course</a> though I'm just going to go through a few modules. 
</p>

<p>
Let's start with Unit 2, Module 5: <a href="https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/syllabus/module.do?context=cf8f63420a0001dc1bb09fcd7fd784a2">Representing Integers</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Hindu-Arabic numeral system is introduced which if you've taken the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html">math</a> foundations beside this programming workshop you already know about. The summation notation for converting binary numbers to decimals: below the sigma (the greek E symbol, which means sum) is the starting index 0. Above the sigma is the range, which is n - 1 since we are beginning at zero, if you wish to sum 4 binary numbers then you want 0 through 3 (0, 1, 2, 3 is 4 digits). \(b_i2^i\) is where you plug in the starting index. The b variable (base) is either 0 or 1 since this is binary:
</p>

<p>
\(b_{0}2^0 + b_{1}2^1 + b_{2}2^2\)&#x2026; for binary number 0101 is (1 * \(2^0\))+(0 * \(2^1\))+(1 * \(2^2\))+(0 * \(2^3\)) as you start from the right of the binary number and sum left. This will make sense when you do the 'do now' exercise.
</p>

<p>
Horner's rule you evaluate by starting with the deepest nested brackets and working to the right. The example you eval the multiplication first then addition: (2 + 1) x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (+ 1) which is 3 x 2 (6) x 2 (12) x 2 (24) x 2 (48) + 1 = 49.  
</p>

<p>
Try the interactive assignment then move on to <a href="https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=cf8f63450a0001dc67eab637081785cd">Adding Binary Numbers</a>. The bit carry you start at the top and work down, so if you have three 1's (a carried bit), then it's 1 + 1 = 0 (carry over a 1), 0 + 1 = 1. Hexadecimal representation is next, the 'did I get this' questions are great for understanding how the 0x notation works, for example 0x10 is 00010000 or 2\(^4\). 
</p>

<p>
We're now on module 6, fixed-precision integers. C0 is pronounced 'c-naught' and is <a href="http://c0.typesafety.net/">similar</a> to C. Note for these assignments if you want more practice, click on reset to keep feeding yourself new questions. There's a typo in <i>Division and Modulus</i>, it should read 9/4 = 2 and the remainder 9 % 4 = 1 for (x / y) * y + (x % y) = x. 
</p>

<p>
The rounding unit points out that Python uses the round to negative infinity rounding strategy. Try some of the examples yourself: (-7) / 3 = -2.333&#x2026; and the strategy for rounding towards O is truncate -2.333 to -2 while rounding to negative infinity you would decrease to -3 instead. Let's explain to ourselves the difference in mod operators too where rounding towards 0 for (-8) % 5 = -3 while rounding towards negative infinity results in -2. The Java/C model (towards 0), you multiply 5 by -1 and the remainder from -5 to -8 is -3. In the Python/negative infinity model, you are finding the lowest multiple of 5, which is less than -8, so 5 x (-2) = -10. The modulus is then the distance between -10 and -8, which is +2. The important takeaway here is to always read the documentation/specs of whatever language you're using, to understand how it's number representation works for integers, floats, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Now we're on module 7 <i>Bit Patterns</i>. The AND operation against a mask such as 0xFF will leave every byte unchanged since if you look at the boolean table if the original bit is 0 or 1 then it will still be 0 or 1. The boolean most significant bit example of 0x80000000 remember 8 in hex is 1000. Let's go through the Bitwise negation example to understand it but with only 8 bytes. Assume x's current state is 0000 0001 everything is off except the first bit, using their home automation model where 1 bit represents a light switch. We want to toggle bit 5, the dining room light:

Module 7 <i>Relating Arithmetic and Bitwise Operations</i> what they are describing is 'complement and increment' as a way to change any binary number to it's negative two's complement representation. The left shift exercise when you look at the answer notice they are shifting around the 1/3 values of blue then using OR to put them all back together into 32bits. The right shifting unit, there's a problem with the answer for 0xC0C0FFEE &gt;&gt; 20 it should be 0xFFFFFC0C but it doesn't recognize it as correct. The last one you have to manually write out the bits, arithmetically shift (padding 1's) to the right 7 bits, then reassemble them from left to right into groups of 4, truncating the furthest right 7 bits to get the answer.

<p>
We're now on module 1 <i>Preconditions - When Do Errors Show up?</i> which is the bulk of 15-122, analyzing imperative code and reasoning about it's correctness. You use code commenting to describe the behavior or a function, and these comments are called contracts. The compiler can statically check these contracts meaning the code is not running. If you watched the <a href="https://youtu.be/lNITrPhl2_A">talk</a> ex CMU prof Simmons gave about contracts I posted earlier in these notes, you'll see that extensive testing covers less than 1% of the field of potential inputs. That same talk he also points out contracts have benefits even for functional languages with strong typing and briefly gives an idea about dependent types as a replacement for contracts, something we'll also briefly cover later.   
</p>


<p>
In <i>When Do Errors Show Up?</i> the example <i>string attach(int n, char c, string str)</i> int, char, and string are similar to Pyret type notations describing what inputs they should accept. Some of the exercises assume syntax knowledge like a char must be in single quotes ie: 'c' (char) vs "c" (string) but otherwise the syntax is easy enough to figure out just by looking at it, and if you make a simple syntax error the system still gives you the correct answer anyway. Module <i>What 'Safety' Means in C0</i> the first learn by doing you're entering statements like n &gt;=0 &amp;&amp; n &lt;=12. The equality boolean is n == 0 (double equal, single is assignment like Pyret). 
</p>

<p>
Moving on to Module 2 <a href="https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=cf8f62f90a0001dc4733a1faff094884">Assertions</a>. These are similar to Pyret check tests. If you're following the math workshop with this programming workshop, you will have no problem understanding their examples of 'point-to reasoning'. It's similar to the proofs we've done in Tao's <i>Analysis</i>, you are listing reasons why something is true by pointing out which axiom or lemma gives it to you. The first <i>learn by doing</i> question has a bug, look at the actual assertion statement and not the 'The assertion x!= 8 is valid' title as sometimes the assertion is x!=20 if you reset the question.
</p>

<p>
Module 2 <i>Conditionals</i> the syntax of [0, 14) which is standard interval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(mathematics)#Intervals">notation</a> for inclusive/exclusive. In the example of @assert x==y, note we are using int's and not floats or roughnums so this assertion is true. If you get stuck on the nested conditionals question notice the @requries x &lt; 10, and if 4 &lt; x makes the nested x &lt;= 16 statement a waste of code. Let's continue on to the <i>Assignments</i> module, the example of if (e &gt; 0) { e = e - 1;.. note again these are integers, so the input can't be 0.5 or a 'half number' that makes e negative after 1 is subtracted. This is a little confusing because they are mixing assignment statements '=' with equality statements in working out their point-to reasoning. The very last assignment took some word smithing, x' + y' &gt; 2 * n. The last question to rewrite the assertion without using primed variables substitute exactly what x and y are into x + y &gt; 2 * n, which is (x * 2) + x &gt; 2 * n.

<h3 id="orgd78b369">Loops</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd78b369">
<p>
Module 2: <i>Introduction to Loops</i> when you mutate data many things can go wrong, so learning how to reason about correct loops will be important to us should we go on to use a Python or some other AI library later. The first example the while loop you can hand step this loop, adjust the varibles with each iteration, then compare them to the assert such as @assert i &gt;=n once the loop exits, since if n = 3, then i should equal 3. Invariants are talked about but not introduced yet, these will be critical to know. An invariant is something that remains constant and doesn't change. 
</p>

<p>
Module 3: <i>Postconditions</i> or what can be shown to be true after a function returns. The first learn by doing example note the brackets that C0 uses to declare scope, you want your first assignment within the first bracket:
</p>

<pre class="example">
int endless_subtraction(int x, int y)
//@requires x &gt; 0;
//@ensures \result &lt; y;
{
  int temp = y;
  while (temp &gt; 0) {
    temp = temp - x;
  }
  return temp;
}
</pre>

<p>
For the next assignment, an example of the @ensures syntax:
</p>

<pre class="example">
//@ensures \result &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; \result % 2 == 0
//@ensures \result == x || \result == -x
</pre>

<p>
In <i>Contract Exploits</i>, I couldn't get the gcd() function exercise to accept my answer: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
//@ensures \result % x == 0 &amp;&amp; \result % y == 0;

However it does accept as correct answer:
//@ensures x % \result == 0 &amp;&amp; y % \result == 0;

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org74e2099">
<p>
Module 3 <i>Introduction to Testing</i> I had no problems answering all the assignments correctly the first time, a testament to the greatness of CS019/PAPL. For the edge cases I used gcd(1, 10) and gcd(10, 1), for the factorial function I used fact(0) is 1. There's numerous pow(base, exp) function edge cases you can come up with like pow(0,2) is 0. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Specification Functions</i> module is interesting, writing an inefficient secondary correct function to test a much faster implementation, or a secondary function to quickly test the result. I used 100,10 as inputs to the incorrect gcd. It uses a for loop, something the text didn't discuss at all before using it but you can probably figure it out anyway (for loops are covered in Module 10). First i is declared and assigned to 1, this is the index. A condition: i must be less or equal to x and i must be less or equal to y for the loop to continue. On each iteration increment i with i++ until i's value doesn't pass the loop condition. This is a completely incorrect implementation for example purposes.

<h3 id="orgf6c96e4">Proving Correctness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf6c96e4">
<p>
Module 4 <i>Proving Correctness</i> let's learn about invariants and correctness proofs. The exercise in <i>Reasoning about Loop Invariants</i> for int test(int lo, int hi) my answers if you're stuck were lo &lt;= i', lo &lt;= i + 1, and i + 1 &lt;= hi. I couldn't get the system to accept i' &lt;= hi which it should be, if the condition on line 10 is i + 1 &lt;= hi. It does however accept i &lt;= hi (without the prime). We found another exercise bug. 
</p>

<p>
Aside: It's sometimes beneficial to have a few bugs in these kinds of courses, because you then challenge your own answer and go through the material again to prove your answer is correct. You'll experience this if you ever use an international version of a popular university textbook which typically sell for only 10% the regular cost. Almost always the end of chapter exercises will have been rewritten by some contractor to force students to buy the full priced version, as often the exercises will be assigned homework. Since the publisher doesn't care at all about the international version it will likely be filled with errata/mistakes in these exercises. You will have to dig deep into the material in order to assure yourself that you have the correct answer and the text is wrong. It also keeps you awake while going through the material.
</p>

<p>
There's another mistake in the very last point-to reasoning question in <i>Proving Correctness</i>, the second loop invariant should be i &lt;= hi instead of lo &lt;= i. In <i>Termination</i> the answers are a little tricky, i + 5 doesn't really make any sense but is still valid since i is decreasing. <i>Proving Functions Correct</i> the last module is very short but enough to put all this material together. Congrats you now know how to reason about a program that mutates it's variables.

<div id="outline-container-orgfa659a0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfa659a0">Arrays</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfa659a0">
<p>
Since we're on a roll let's finish this entire course, starting with Module 8 <i>C0 Memory Model for Simple Types</i>. In <i>Function Calls</i> in a C program main() is called first, which is usually at the bottom. The first learn by doing exercise you are only determining what fast pow is being called with (parameters), so x and y. The second is hand stepping the function one iteration. You can see how difficult this can become, trying to keep the entire state of a program's variables in your head. In Pyret and other functional languages you don't have to do this, since variables are immutable. The recursion module should be easy to figure out since we've already done a lot of recursion with Pyret. 
</p>

<p>
The first array exercise actually runs your code, this was mine, note we are using booleans, so &amp;&amp;, || or !.
</p>
<details>
<pre class="example">
bool[] B = alloc_array(bool, 4);
B[0] = b;
B[1] = !B[0];
B[2] = B[0] &amp;&amp; B[1];
B[3] = B[1] || B[0];
</pre>
</details>

<p>
The second array exercise also runs your code, I copied the examples for int[]:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
char[][] C = alloc_array(char[], 3);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    C[i] = alloc_array(char, 2);
}
C[0][0] = 'a';
C[0][1] = 'b';
C[1][0] = 'c';
C[1][1] = 'd';
C[2][0] = 'e';
C[2][1] = 'f';
</pre>
</details>

<p>
In Module 9 <i>The C0 Memory Model</i> the first assignment asks you to open the c0 interpreter and find out what the default initialized value is for an array of type boolean. I guessed it was false instead of using the interpreter since false would be the obvious design choice. You can try the online interpreter for c0 <a href="https://c0.surge.sh/">here</a>. At the end of this module they example a contract calling a helper function with \length(A) being used as an input in order to find the length of the array, with a warning that this is a hacky method that won't work if contracts aren't enabled in production since that assert statement won't be run. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2758555" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2758555">Aliasing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2758555">
<p>
Scope and aliasing can be difficult topics to learn, as per this paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/tfk-stu-underst-alias-proc-calls/">Prof Shriram</a>'s Brown Univeristy page where upper-level students even failed to understand aliasing. That paper is worth looking at, to see how confusing this can become in some languages like Java where one change affects two different locations, as they both point to the same thing. The exercises on this page can get tricky, remember that A = B if true means array A and B share the same memory location and are thus the same array. A[1] = B[1] if true means the values stored at those indexes are the same. 
</p>

<p>
Moving on to module 10 <i>Coding with Arrays</i> we run into more aliasing. Here they decide to introduce for loops even though they were already used previously. The main difference between a while loop and a for loop, is you want to use a for loop when the range is known, and a while loop for unknown amounts of loops, such as waiting for a user to enter a key, or summing an arbitrary amount of inputs. Since an array is a fixed range you'd use a for loop for our array copy program.  The learn by doing for summing an array, all you need to do here is declare int sum = 0 then in the body of the for loop keep a running sum, returning it outside the loop. Better code you'd have an if test to see if n == 0 then return 0 (sum of an empty array) but I didn't bother and it accepted my answer anyway. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
int sum = 0; 
for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
   sum += A[i];
}
return sum;
// grader doesn't like sum = sum + A[i], preferring the += syntax instead


//the 'did I get this' exercise
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
   sum += i;
}
return sum;
//note the 'between 0 and n' meaning exclusive of n

</pre>
</details>

<p>
In <i>Safety of Array Code</i> you can see how difficult this can become to prove safety such as needing to guarantee the loop never reaches INT MAX. The very last <i>did I get this</i> question asks you to prove access to B[i] is safe, which there is only one answer and what we just covered in this module (the loop invariant). The rest of the exercises get harder and harder, but you will eventually figure them out and get better at 'point to reasoning'. For example the reasoning in array copy after the postcondition is added, how can we prove the postcondition is correct: if array B is created with length of n, and returned, then the postcondition must be correct. In <i>Correctness of Array Code</i> I couldn't get the system to accept my answer, which was originally A[i] == B[i] and return true, false otherwise. The accepted answer is to check if they don't equal, return true otherwise:
</p>

<pre class="example">
bool is_same_array(int[] A, int[] B, int n)
 //@requires n == \length(A) &amp;&amp; n == \length(B)
{ 
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
 //@loop_invariant 0 &lt;= i
 {
   if (A[i] != B[i]) 
   return false; 
  } 
  
  return true;
}
</pre>

<p>
For Module 10 <i>Contract Exploits w/Array Code</i> the learn by doing assignment wants you to write assert statements such as assert(A[0] == 0);, checking A's elements are not modified by array copy. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5c7e207" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5c7e207">Searching and Sorting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c7e207">
<p>
The loop invariant in the first search function is suspect, as that invariant will be broken the first iteration. From the assignment questions this appears to be a typo, that it should read 0 &lt;= i instead. In Module 11 this is a confirmed typo, as the same function is repeated but with the fixed invariant. The first search learn by doing there's a few typos you'll catch, like search(100, x, A, 0, 10) when our search function only takes 4 parameters not 5. The last exercise in <i>Searching in a sorted Array</i> is easy once you've done the other exercises, only the 3rd line was a problem which was assert that A[i] &lt; x, a kind of pointless assertion since if A[i] is not x, and A[i] is not bigger than x (remember it's a sorted array), then our present iteration of A[i] must be less than x. In <i>Reasoning about the search function</i> the first exercise any function calls in the requires/ensures/assert contracts need to be checked for safety violations, and any statement accessing arrays in the @ensures postconditions, assert contracts or body of the code. The feedback for the correct answer on the last exercise is wrong but by now you should be pretty good at point to reasoning. The postcondition in the last exercise is correct because the array has a precondition that it's already sorted, there's a loop invariant that the desired value is not in the array so far making a call to a boolean function with the current value of i, there's 2 assert statements and an if block that if A[current loop index] is bigger than x, then clearly x isn't in the array since it's a sorted array. 
</p>

<p>
At this point, believe it or not, you know all there is to know about basic imperative programming and can go through the docs of any mainstream language like Python3.x for a future AI course. What we didn't cover was manual C pointers which if you wanted could go through the slides of the full 15-122 <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/schedule.shtml">course</a> or try a systems <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#orgf43f5fd">course</a> that shows how these pointers work at the assembly level. Since we care about AI and will likely be using Python soon this course was a great intro to reasoning about code that mutates memory.

<h3 id="orgfe8484e">Complexity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe8484e">
<p>
We made it to the last unit on complexity.  
</p>

<p>
The first example: 3n + 4 \(\in\) O(2n - 1)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>try n = 1</li>
<li>7 \(\le\) c(1) so c = 7 and technically that answer is fine, f(3n + 4) is still in O(n)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Their assignment: 3n + 4 \(\in\) O(2\(n^2\) + 3n + 1) 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try n = 1:</li>
<li>7 \(\le\) c(2(\(1^2\)) + 3(1) + 1)</li>
<li>7 \(\le\) c(6)</li>
<li>You could claim c = 2 or find a better approximation of n:</li>
<li>Try n = 2:</li>
<li>3(2) + 4 \(\le\) c(2(\(2^2\))+ 3(2) + 1</li>
<li>10 \(\le\) c(15)</li>
<li>True, so \(n_0\) = 2 and c = 1 though c = 2 is still a valid upper bound since f(n) is in O(\(n^2\))</li>
<li>c = anything would be fine since n is always going to be bounded by \(n^2\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There's an optional assignment, to show 2\(n^2\) + 3n + 1 is not in O(3n + 4)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try n = 1</li>
<li>2(1) + 3(1) + 1 \(\le\) c7</li>
<li>Try n = 2</li>
<li>2(4) + 3(2) + 1 \(\le\) c10</li>
<li>Try n = 3</li>
<li>2(9) + 3(3) + 1 \(\le\) c13 or 28 &lt; c13</li>
<li>We can see at this point that no matter what constant we pick for c, the \(n^2\) variable on the left will always be greater eventually than whatever we choose the constant c to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The did I get this assignment will be easy, whatever polynomial has the highest degree it will bound the lower degree polynomial since n can't outgrow \(n^k\). In <i>Simplest and Tightest Bound</i> what they are saying here is if your steps are 3n + 1, you don't want to pick any giant bound such as 3n + 1 is \(\in\) \(n^4\). You want the tightest bound, which is n, or whatever the maximum power is of f(n). If there is no variable n then the tightest bound is O(1) or constant time. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>Complexity Classes</i> module assumes you remember <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Logarithm">logarithms</a> the inverse of exponentiation. Let's try the example using the logarithmic properties from that AoPS page:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3n(2+ log 2\(n^3\))</li>
<li>6n + 3n log 2\(n^3\)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From AoPS: log bc = log b + log c</li>
</ul></li>
<li>6n + 3n(log 2 + log \(n^3\))
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From AoPs: log \(b^n\) = n log b</li>
</ul></li>
<li>6n + 3n(log2 + 3 log n)</li>
<li>6n + 3n log2 + 9n log n
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>6n is in O(n) complexity class obviously</li>
<li>3n log 2 is in O(n) because the constant 2</li>
<li>9n log n is in O(n log n) since n is not constant</li>
<li>We pick the biggest class: O(n log n)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Try the exercises for determining complexity class:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>log (3\(n^2\)) - 2</li>
<li>log 3 + log \(n^2\) - 2</li>
<li>log 3 + 2 log n - 2
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>complexity class: log n</li>

In this module don't worry about their fancy square matrix functions only what the code overall structure is (nested loops where functions are called, constant time returns, etc). In <i>Beyond n</i> I couldn't get the last exercise about n collection of images but correctly guessed 'wh' since we're still making a copy. It doesn't matter if you don't get these immediately you will gain through experience how to estimate complexity. 
</p>

<p>
The last module <i>Experimentally Testing Complexity</i> the cost form an+b is what we've seen before such as 3n + 7, and this chapter is about analyzing a running program to discover what the multiplying constant is (the a in an). To figure out if it's n, \(n^2\), \(n^3\) read the introduction where doubling the size of the input should get double the cost if it's O(n), four times the cost if it's O(\(n^2\)), eight times the cost if it's O(\(n^3\)). The first activity that is f(n) = an<sup>2</sup>, notice the time goes from 0.02 -&gt; 0.08 -&gt; 0.28 -&gt; 1.05 etc. That's roughly 4x the cost or \(n^2\). The matrix mult activity has roughly 8x the cost after n &gt; 400. There's an error in the assignments, I couldn't get my answers accepted unless I multiplied 'a' by 100,000,000 not 10,000,000. In fact if you check their example chart for vector-above-avg-better, they have clearly multiplied 'a' by 100 million not 10 million. 
</p>

<p>
The last learn by doing assignment 0.38sec multiplied by 4 is 1.52 or close enough to the next doubled input, so this function must be \(n^2\). Multiplying f(n)/n<sup>2</sup> you end up with roughly a = 0.6 and there's an interesting follow up on how you can screw up your tests since the initialization of the test is \(n^2\) but the function cost is only n.

Now we can do the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2017/big-O-lab-2.pdf">second lab</a>.

Several optimizations are listed in the article, one is switching to insertion sort when the number of elements remaining to be sorted are under some threshold. Since insertion sort efficiency for small lists in the best/average case scenario was repeatedly talked about in lectures I'm going to guess this is the solution they expect you to come up with since as we will see soon every single comparison sort style algorithm has the same worst case complexity, unless this whole task is just a trick to get you to see how hopeless it is to try and improve the worst case complexity of quicksort.

The next task is to read some <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~liorma/cpsc320/files/sorting-2x2.pdf">slides</a> up to and including the lower bound slides, coincidentally from the same school I once went to though I wish our classes were as good as CS019. The decision tree is somewhat confusing at first, a&lt;b means abc, acb, cab, as in 'a' appears before 'b' does in that permutation. Lower bound slide, n! leaves, there are 6 leaves (meaning branches with no children) and since this tree is n = 3, n! is 1x2x3 or 6. The lower bound proof look at the first example of logarithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">here</a> if \(2^{h+1}\) \(\ge\) \(n!\) then \(h + 1\) \(\ge\) \(\log_2 n!\) because \(b^y = x\) is \(log_b x = y\). The task is to explain how this relates to our previous problem of attempting to optimize quicksort, and these slides prove that <i>every</i> comparison sort algorithm has the same worst case \(\Omega\)([n -&gt; n log n]) comparisons. However I recall him telling us in lecture that insertion sort for a small list can help with the average/best case (note worse case obviously stays the same).

1.1 Tasks, sum all integers in a list requires linear work to go through the list and get the elements so this must be minimum O([k -&gt; k]) unless they were in some kind of sequential order where you could use a closed form solution, like n(n -1)/2. Looking at the recurrence relations chapter in PAPL, this is doing constant work at every step, so T(k) = T(k - 1) + c where the c is addition of elements. The rest of the tasks look at the chapter on <i>Predicting Growth</i> in PAPL and see if there is a corresponding recurrence. They did however, make sure to point out we're using integers, so this opens the door to tricks we can do on only even or odd integers such as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/previous-semesters/2012-spring/resources/lectures/05.pdf">fast exponentiation</a> but even with those tricks the minimum runtime for going through an n sized list, and at each element doing constant work on an entire other list of size n won't change it's recurrence of T(k) = (k - 1) + k. 
</p>

<p>
Formal analysis writeup, use it as a template to look at the other function.
</p>

<p>
The last optional task asks how you would implement silly flipper in linear time. The original function calls reverse at every single element. Really all it's doing is linking first, last-rest, first-rest, last-rest - 1 .. so two lists input, the orig and reversed version, link(f, ff) and then on empty case use .take() to truncate. Linear reverse is described in the above pdf on fast exponentiation.

This is a great intro course as the assignments are similar to what you'd be doing outside of school, such as using a Python library to pull down data from a website API and it arrives as lists nested within some other data structure and needs to be unpacked and cleaned such as dealing with the newline character "\n" in this assignment. Here we are restricted from using list built-ins, so things like member(), append(), or distinct() you'll have to write these yourself, the book considers rewriting library functions as drill exercises since programming is learn by doing. 
</p>

<p>
We need to fill in recommend() and popular-pairs() according to the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2019/nilenile.html">spec</a> we're given. Don't use their 2018 starter template, there's some kind of bug where accessing the content of a recommendation doesn't work. Write your own or use <a href="https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=0Bxr4FfLa3goOMmI2RnlkWUhCTzA">this</a>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
provide *
provide-types *

data Recommendation&lt;A&gt;:
  | recommendation(count :: Number, content :: List&lt;A&gt;)
end

data File:
  | file(name :: String, content :: String)
end

fun recommend(title :: String, book-records :: List&lt;File&gt;) -&gt; Recommendation:
  doc: ```Takes in the title of a book and a list of files,
       and returns a recommendation of book(s) to be paired with title
       based on the files in book-records.```
  recommendation(0, empty)
end

fun popular-pairs(records :: List&lt;File&gt;) -&gt; Recommendation:
  doc: ```Takes in a list of files and returns a recommendation of
       the most popular pair(s) of books in records.```
  recommendation(0, empty)
end
</pre>

<p>
Examples to help understand what the assignment is asking for, you can run this to see if the tests are at least well formed:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun recommend(title :: String, book-records :: List&lt;File&gt;) -&gt; Recommendation:
  doc: ```Takes in the title of a book and a list of files,
       and returns a recommendation of book(s) to be paired with title
      based on the files in book-records.```
  recommendation(0, empty)
where:
  r1 = file("a", "1984\nCrime and Punishment\nHeaps are Lame\nLord of the Flies")
  r2 = file("b", "1984\nHeaps are Lame\nLord of the Flies")
  r3 = file("c", "1984\nCrime and Punishment\nHeaps are Lame\nCalculus")
  r4 = file("d", "Crime and Punishment\n1984\nLord of the Flies")
  input = [list: r1, r2, r3, r4]

  recommend("1984", input) is recommendation(3, [list: "Heaps are Lame", "Crime and Punishment", "Lord of the Flies"])
  recommend("Heaps are Lame", input) is recommendation(3, [list: "Crime and Punishment", "1984", "Lord of the Flies"])
  recommend("War", [list: file("q", "War\nPeace")]) is recommendation(1, [list: "Peace"])
  recommend("PAPL", input) is  recommendation(0, empty)
 

  # These are their tests from 2016 Nile writeup:
  f1=file("alist.txt","1984\nAnimal Farm\nHigurashi\nLife of Pi")
  f2=file("blist.txt","Animal Farm\nHigurashi\nLife of Pi")
  f3=file("clist.txt","1984\nHeart of Darkness")
  input2 = [list: f1, f2, f3]

  recommend("1925", input2) is recommendation(0,[list: ])
  recommend("1984", input2) is recommendation(1,[list: "Animal Farm","Higurashi","Life of Pi","Heart of Darkness"])
end
</pre>

<p>
Start again by writing as if functions already exist for what you want to do, creating templates if you wish for a function. My strategy is map through the input, extract the file.content string of "Title\nTitle", and return a single list of all titles that have been recommended.  
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun recommend(title :: String, book-records :: List&lt;File&gt;) -&gt; Recommendation:

 list-of-titles = fold(lam(acc, elt): acc.append(elt) end, empty, map(lam(x): make-list(title, x) end, book-records))
 produce-rec(list-of-titles)
where
.. tests
end 
</pre>

<p>
I wished for a function called make-list(), fed into a fold to append the return into a single [list: "title", "title"]:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# note recommend(title, book-records) are in scope here, if make-list is inside recommend
# you can change parameters to make-list(f :: File) and freely use title inside body of make-list 

fun make-list(search-title :: String, f :: File) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  doc: "Tests if title is recommended, returns filtered list of f.content minus searched for title"

  new-list = f-to-list(f.content)
  if new-list.member(search-title):
    filter(lam(x): if x == search-title: false else: true end end, new-list)
  else:
    empty      
  end
where:
  make-list("A", file("", "A\nB\nC")) is [list: "B", "C"]
end

</pre>

<p>
Another wished for function, f-to-list() which I expect extracts the f.content string, converts to a list and returns so it can be tested for membership. Notice I left the input to f-to-list() a single input, and the helper inside deals with accumulators/appending the newline character. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun f-to-list(s :: String) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  doc:" Consumes string Title\nTitle and returns [list: Title, Title]"

  fun helper(acc, l-a):
    doc: "Breaks on newline character and links accumulator"
    cases (List) l-a:
      | empty =&gt; empty 
      | link(f, r) =&gt; 
        if f == 10:
          link(string-from-code-points(acc), helper(empty, r))
        else:
          helper(acc + [list: f], r)
        end
    end
  end
  helper(empty, string-to-code-points(s + "\n"))
where:
  f-to-list("1984\nHeart of Darkness") is [list: "1984", "Heart of Darkness"]
end
</pre>

<p>
Now complete wished for function produce-rec() which receives a list of all recommended titles, duplicates meaning they were recommended more than once. This is the first draft, the second draft is seeing where you can redesign to minimize the complexity or completely scrap the entire program and rewrite it from scratch, which is normal as you now know a little more about the requirements needed and can plan a better program.

<h4 id="org70f2ef8">popular-pairs()</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org70f2ef8">
<p>
Using the 2019 <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2019/nilenile.html">Nile</a> assignment spec, notice the new datatype for popular-pairs(), this will be inside a recommendation instead of a list of titles: recommendation(2, [list: pair(book1, book2), pair(book2, book3)] and the return annotation is popular-pairs() -&gt; Recommendation&lt;BookPair&gt;:
</p>
<pre class="example">
data BookPair:
    | pair(book1 :: String, book2 :: String)

<p>
From the examples you write, notice the pattern is f paired w/r, fr paired w/rr, etc.

<p>
This assignment we're building a testing oracle. Let's try this using some of the design recipe shilled in the lectures: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify what must be represented and how it is represented</li>
<li>State what kind of data the function consumes and produces</li>
<li>Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose</li>
<li>Write an outline of the function</li>
<li>Fill in the gaps</li>
<li>Test it</li>
</ul>

<p>
First function is generate-input(n :: Number) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;, it consumes a number, and produces a list of length n of type Person. Since this function is going to generate random person.name strings we can't directly match the output in a test case, but we can still confirm it has the correct properties of [list: person(name, number)]:
</p>

<pre class="example">
data Person:
  | person(name :: String, age :: Number)
end

fun generate-input(n :: Number) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
  doc:"Generate random n size list of person(name, age), name is length 4, age is 1 - 100"
  ...
where:
  # confirm size
  L.length(generate-input(5)) is L.length([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  map(lam(x): (string-length(x.name) &gt; 0) is true end, generate-input(5))  

  # make sure the age is within 1 - 100
  map(lam(x): ((x.age &gt; 0) and (x.age &lt;= 100)) is true end, generate-input(5))
 
 # confirm name is ASCII code points from 97 - 122 
 # string-to-code-points() returns a list, so nested map
  map(lam(x): map(lam(y): ((y &gt;= 97) and (y &lt;= 122)) is true end, string-to-code-points(x.name)) end, generate-input(3)) 
end

</pre>

<p>
Pyret has a built-in function for generating a list <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html#(part._lists_repeat)">repeat()</a> which we will need to write ourselves since this assignment doesn't allow using built-ins outside of the higher order functions and sort() or sort-by() though I used some list built-ins here and in the test cases since we already rewrote them in the Nile assignment. One way we could architect this is recursing on n, linking a list together. So num-random() gives us something resembling a random name, see this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">article</a>, code points I guess could be between 97 and 122 or 'a' and 'z' though you could just leave this random and fuzzy test:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun generate-input(n :: Number) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
  doc:"Generate random n size list of person(name, age)"

  fun random-name(s :: Number, name-string :: String) -&gt; String:
    doc: "Generate a random string between ASCII 97 - 122 of length s"
    if s &lt; 1:
      name-string
    else:
      single = num-random(33) + 90
      if (single &gt;= 97) and (single &lt;= 122):
        random-name(s - 1, string-from-code-point(single) + name-string)
      else:
        random-name(s, name-string)
      end
    end
  where:
    string-length(random-name(5, "")) is 5
    string-length(random-name(1, "")) is 1
  end

  fun helper(num :: Number, acc :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
    doc: "Consumes n, init acc and returns [list: person(name, age)] n times"    
    if num &lt; 1:
      acc
    else: 
      name-length = num-random(25) + 1
      helper(num - 1, link(person(random-name(name-length, ""), num-random(100) + 1), acc))
     # acc on first call is a placeholder here for empty
     # this will return ...link(item, link(item, orig-acc)) 
    end
  end

  # preconditions
  if n &lt; 1:
    raise("Input must be greater than 0")
  else:
    helper(n, empty)
  end
where:
  # confirm size
  L.length(generate-input(5)) is L.length([list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  map(lam(x): (string-length(x.name) &gt; 0) is true end, generate-input(2))  

  # make sure the age is within 1 - 100
  map(lam(x): ((x.age &gt; 0) and (x.age &lt;= 100)) is true end, generate-input(2))
  # confirm name is ASCII code points from 97 - 122 
  map(lam(x): map(lam(y): ((y &gt;= 97) and (y &lt;= 122)) is true end, string-to-code-points(x.name)) end, generate-input(2)) 

  # confirm input is &gt; 0
  generate-input(0) raises "Input must be greater than 0"
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
Now we have what the assignment is looking for:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; generate-input(2)
[list: person("vwqukq", 3), person("rljhrsijqcwyuglwjtnhc", 48)]
</pre>

<p>
Next is a sort validation function that consumes two sorted lists of type Person, and compares if they are both the same returning a boolean true or false. This is similar to 15-122 when we would call an inefficient and obviously correct version of the same program in order to satisfy the postcondition the output is the same. Start with basic tests as usual:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun is-valid(test-input :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
  ...
where:
  is-valid([list: person("a", 31), person("b", 30)],[list: person("b", 30), person("a", 31)]) is true
  is-valid([list: person("c", 10), person("d", 10)]) is true 
  is-valid(empty, empty) is true
  is-valid([list: person("a", 31)], empty) is false
end
</pre>

<p>
To compare if the first sorted input list is equal to the correct sorted list, we could map2 over both lists to see if .age is equal, then fold over the list map2 returns comparing each entry with 'true'. This is inefficient as a case statement can break on the first instance of false instead of continuing through the entire linear list: 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun is-valid(test-input :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
  doc: "Consumes l1 a sorted list and compares to l2 a correct-sorter() list"

  fun length-test(test-input-a :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input-a :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
    doc: "Test if both lists are the same length"
    (L.length(test-input-a)) == (L.length(correct-input-a))
  end

  fun name-test(test-input-b :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input-b :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
    doc: "Test if any names have been altered"
    correct-sorted-names = correct-sorter(test-input-b)
    names = map2(lam(n1 :: Person, n2 :: Person): (n1.name == n2.name) end, correct-sorted-names, correct-input-b)
    L.foldl(lam(a :: Boolean, b :: Boolean): a and b end, true, names)
  end

  fun age-sort-test(test-input-c :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input-c :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
    doc: "Test if sorted by age correctly"
    age-test = map2(lam(n3 :: Person, n4 :: Person): (n3.age == n4.age) end, test-input-c, correct-input-c)
    L.foldl(lam(c :: Boolean, d :: Boolean): c and d end, true, age-test)
  end

  fun age-and-name-sort-test(test-input-d :: List&lt;Person&gt;, correct-input-d :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
    doc: "See if the names and ages match, this will fail occasionally for qsort on duplicate ages"
    both-test = map2(lam(n5 :: Person, n6 :: Person): (n5.name == n6.name) and (n5.age == n6.age) end, test-input-d, correct-input-d)
    L.foldl(lam(e :: Boolean, f :: Boolean): e and f end, true, both-test)
  end

  # return the results
  if length-test(test-input, correct-input)
    and
    name-test(test-input, correct-input)
    and
    age-sort-test(test-input, correct-input)
    and
    age-and-name-sort-test(test-input, correct-input):

  else:

  end
where:

  is-valid([list: person("a", 31)], empty) is false
  is-valid([list: person("", 31)], [list: person("a", 31)]) is false 
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
Now we go about writing multiple buggy implementations of sorting algorithms and test these functions with oracle :: (List&lt;Person&gt; -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; Boolean ie: oracle(insertion-sort)) or oracle(quick-sort):
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun combine(lt, p, gt):
  doc: "Used by quicksort"
  lt.append([list: p]).append(gt)
end

fun qsort(l :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
  doc: "Quicksort from lectures"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(pivot, r) =&gt;
      combine(
        qsort(r.filter(lam(n): n.age &lt; pivot.age end)),
        pivot,
        qsort(r.filter(lam(n): n.age &gt;= pivot.age end)))
  end
end

fun incorrect-qsort(l :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
  doc: "Sabotaged quicksort"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(pivot, r) =&gt;
      combine(
        incorrect-qsort(r.filter(lam(n): n.age &lt; pivot.age end)),
        pivot,
        incorrect-qsort(r.filter(lam(n): n.age &gt; pivot.age end)))
  end
end

# empty case test
fun empty-sort(p :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;: 
  empty 
end

# deletes the names
fun name-screwed(w :: List&lt;Person&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;:
  correct = L.sort-by(w,
    lam(p1, p2): p1.age &lt; p2.age end,
    lam(p1, p2): p1.age == p2.age end)
  (map(lam(x): person("", x.age) end, correct))
end

fun oracle(f :: (List&lt;Person&gt; -&gt; List&lt;Person&gt;))-&gt; Boolean:
  doc: "Testing oracle for sorting lists of type Person"

  random-input = generate-input(num-random(30) + 5)
  is-valid(f(random-input), correct-sorter(random-input))
where:
  oracle(qsort) is true
  oracle(incorrect-qsort) is false
  oracle(name-screwed) is false
  oracle(empty-sort) is false
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
These tests won't always pass, because sometimes incorrect-qsort() will produce the correct output, it's only on edge cases with duplicate ages that it won't pass our oracle test case. Quicksort will also sometimes produce a different sort sequence for multiple same ages where the names will differ than the sequence correct-sorter() is using. 
</p>

<p>
If you were a student at Brown actually taking this course, you would have to write a much larger set of tests since the grading TAs would be running your oracle against a suite of incorrect sorting algorithms. Some things you'd need to check are: missing ages, all random inputs not just ASCII characters (fuzzy testing), empty names with the same or different ages. I sterilized the input to the oracle sorters but they probably don't when grading.

where:
  bmi-report([list: phr("eugene", 2, 60, 77),
      phr("matty", 1.55, 58.17, 56 ),
      phr("ray", 1.8, 55, 84),

    [list: ],                # over
    [list: "mike"]           # obese
    )
end
</pre>

<p>
My solution was to write a helper function bmi(p :: PHR) -&gt; Number and then filter each list for under, healthy, over, obese. Return bmi-summary by mapping over those filtered lists for lam(x): x.name, try adding more test cases like the empty case, or multiple same names. Assignment claims we can assume no entry will be zero so we don't need a test case for division by zero.

You could want tests for empty, one element, two elements, and the given assignment example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
fun data-smooth(phrs :: List&lt;PHR&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
  doc: "Smooth heart rate data"
...
where:
  # given example from assignment writeup
  data-smooth([list: phr("eugene", 2, 60, 95),
      phr("matty", 1.55, 58.17, 102),
      phr("ray", 1.8, 55, 98),
      phr("mike", 1.5, 100, 88), phr("a", 2, 2, 105)]) is [list: 95, 295/3, 96, 97, 105]

  # empty test
  data-smooth(empty) is empty

  # one element test
  data-smooth([list: phr("spock", 3, 2, 1)]) is [list: 1]

  # two element test
  data-smooth([list: phr("spock2", 1, 2, 90), phr("spock3", 3, 4, 91)]) is [list: 90, 91]
end
</pre>
<p>
One way to try this assignment is recurse on length with (prior + l.first + l.rest.first) / 3 then before your helper function returns, append the last element which we want unchanged. Before your data-smooth function returns append the first element to .rest of what helper returned, since we want the first element unchanged too.

<h4 id="orgd873b5c">frequent-words()</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd873b5c">

I wrote this template:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# optional
data Freq:

end

fun frequent-words(words :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:

  frequent-words([list: "silver", "james", "james", "silver",
      "howlett", "silver", "loganne", "james", "loganne"])
    is  [list: "james", "silver", "loganne"]
  frequent-words([list: "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "c"]) is [list: "a", "b"]
  # corner case, all words are only 1 frequency so return sorted
  frequent-words([list: "james", "so"]) is [list: "so", "james"  ]
  frequent-words(empty) is empty
end
</pre>

<p>
The assignment wants a list returned of words, in descending order of freq count, sorted by smallest string length if there's a tie. If the highest frequency count is greater than 1, then you return those words otherwise return the list sorted if there are no freq greater than 1 is how I interpret the assignment. I made a distinct list, mapped over it and at each distinct list entry filtered the total input list 'words' to get a list of same words, storing x.word and the length of whatever list that filter returned to get frequency("word", 3). I then obtained the highest frequency count, and used it to recurse on, creating a new list if x.count == count breaking on if count &lt; 2. Before appending to a helper function accumulator I used sort-by() from the <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html#(part._lists_sort-by)">documentation</a>. If the highest freq count however was only 1 then I sorted and returned the list. Maybe you can engineer a simpler way.

<p>
I completed this with 2 functions maxx(), and a helper(). I filtered sensor-data for the month desired to get a distinctlist of all dates of that month [list: 20151004, 20151005, 20151007] since if you multiply month by 100, and add 20150000 you get the desired month. Then I called helper(distinct-list, sensor-data) which tested if f was a member of my distinct month list. If so I called maxx to find the highest count that day: link(max-hz(f, maxx(r), helper(distinct-list, r))).

An interesting paper from his page authored with Prof K you should read is <i>The Human in Formal Methods</i>. In it they write about porting the method of example writing we've been doing to this domain. A common learning mistake that students make is talked about, in that they write programs before they have understood the problem, as a result they 'solve' the wrong problem, which misdirected from the learning goals. We so far have been writing examples and tests, so are a bit better at understanding the problem before writing the software but this paper makes it clear we should probably be writing much more examples and tests, and even try finding invariants.

Notice the typo in oldest-song() examples, using lvar instead of lver (always run the examples so they pass). In fact this chapter has a few errors, but of course they could be intentional due to that awesome disclaimer in the beginning of the book. You can rewrite oldest-song() using just a single fold statement: if (current-year - x.year) &gt; acc.year: x else: acc. Fold does all the magic for you taking anything you return such as x (the song) and puts it in the accumulator as it iterates over the list.

The recursive data definitions that we saw in Lecture 7, and they hand step through a recursive function. Seems like this should be in chapter 1. The design recipe template from HtDP book for recursive data definitions is also shown. For the 3 exercises, cut and paste the recursive template and try filling it in to complete the exercises, notice how easy it is, that's why they shill the design recipe. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
data NumList:
  | nl-empty
  | nl-link(first :: Number, rest :: NumList)
end

#|
fun num-list-fun(nl :: NumList) -&gt; ???:
  cases (NumList) nl:
    | nl-empty =&gt; ...
    | nl-link(first, rest) =&gt;
      ... first ...
      ... num-list-fun(rest) ...
  end
end
|#

</pre>
<p>
The HtDP method is first uncomment the template, change the function name and the recursive call name to w/e name your function is. Change the annotation for the return such as -&gt; Boolean. If you add a parameter, add one to the recursive call too. Now the function pretty much fills out itself. Try the exercises, the very last one I interpreted as:
</p>

<pre class="example">
data NumListList:
  | nll-empty
  | nll-link(first :: NumList, rest :: NumListList)

We're watching Mon9/24/18 lecture on sets. When he shortens insert() to equal link, try it in the pyret repl: insert = link, insert(2, empty) produces [list: 2]. The end of this lecture discussing the big-O complexity of both representations he points out the inefficient blue representation is better depending on what you care about, like appending a log you often don't look at. Note some of the students had problems figuring out the big-O, it's expected at this stage you only have a familiarity with costs and that true understanding will come later with more experience and during an algorithms book/class which has various analysis techniques we haven't been taught yet that make it much easier.

We haven't covered 18.2 yet so just reading 18.1, covers what we just saw in the lecture representing sets using lists. Again this is a good course because you have to manually implement everything yourself including built-ins such as all the set built-ins. 
</p>

<p>
There's a link to the <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2019/glossary.html">glossary</a>, interesting definitions in there such as links to a paper on coalgebras/coinduction. In the size() recurrence, remember the chapter <i>Predicting Growth</i> where common recurrences are listed such as T(k) = T(k - 1) + k is \([k \rightarrow k^2]\) because it's closed form solution is: \(\frac{k^2 + k}{2}\) hence T(d) = d + (d - 1) is also \([d \rightarrow d^2]\).
</p>

<p>
End of 18.1.3 notes your program could keep running stats about which representation of insert() to use and make a decision. The exercises here you can do in your head, thinking of types to give these operations like subset() or how remove is going to work, obviously it must remove all the duplicates if the representation allows for duplicates which is easy to implement if f == removed-thing, skip over it and link the rest. I'm not exactly sure about the last exercise, I'm assuming they want us to consider that type LSet = List is not good enough, and to create an entire new datatype of nl-set since Set datatype is already built-in, like we did for nl-link.

<p>
Run the template then try to give matchmaker some inputs to see what it does:
</p>

<pre class="example">
companies =  [list: [list: 1, 0, 2], [list: 0, 2, 1], [list: 0, 2, 1]]
candidates = [list: [list: 1, 0, 2], [list: 1, 2, 0], [list: 0, 1, 2]]
# Note matchmaker writeup: it is 0 to n-1 indexed, so 3 lists means 0 - 2 

matchmaker(companies, candidates)
&gt;&gt;[list-set: hire(2, 1), hire(1, 0), hire(0, 2)]
</pre>

<p>
First Let's understand the matching algorithm, we don't have to write one ourselves but we have to know how it works in order to test all the false matchmaker algorithms in our oracle. Wikipedia has a section on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem#Algorithmic_solution">Gale-Shapely algorithm</a>. As usual Wikipedia is incomplete or has imprecise language, so let's look at the actual <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">paper</a>. Scroll down to Theorem 1: <i>There always exists a stable set of marriages</i> and look at the proof for the algorithm:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First round:</li>
<li>Companies all select their first preferred candidate</li>
<li>Candidates accept provisionally, if a more preferred offer is presented in next rounds they will reject this one
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rejected companies are put into a pool</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second round:</li>
<li>Companies in the pool with no matching then all select their second preferred candidate</li>
<li>Candidates accept or reject upon preferences</li>
<li>X rounds:</li>
<li>Repeat, noting that no company can offer more than once to a candidate</li>
</ul>

<p>
The 2019 assignment writeup contains a few hints, such as 'be cautious about using the provided matchmaker function in your oracle as this assumes that there is only one right answer to a given instance of the stable hiring problem'. I translate this to mean there could be many permutations of the stable-hiring problem which are still correct, however the Gale-Shipley algorithm produces the exact same matching everytime if the company is making offers, and candidates rejecting. What if the roles are reversed, if it is candidate making offers and company rejecting, is the matching then different? We have 2 inputs into matchmaker but it doesn't say which one is actually making the offers and which input is rejecting. We should try altering the inputs and see what happens: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
companies =  [list: [list: 1, 0, 2], [list: 0, 2, 1], [list: 0, 2, 1]]
candidates = [list: [list: 1, 0, 2], [list: 1, 2, 0], [list: 0, 1, 2]]

&gt;&gt;matchmaker(candidates, companies)
[list-set: hire(2,2), hire(1,0), hire(0,1)]

&gt;&gt;matchmaker(companies, candidates)
[list-set: hire(2,1), hire(1,0), hire(0,2)]
</pre>

<p>
They're different, so there is indeed more than one solution to the problem depending on if the bias is towards candidates or companies. So how are we going to test. Googling around I find an old book, entirely on the Stable Marriage problem <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15251-f10/Site/Materials/Lectures/Lecture21/lecture21.pdf">here</a>. On page 8 <i>Stability Checking</i> we are given a stability checking algorithm and on page 7 this is more clearly defined. For each company C, look at their preferences and check that each candidate they prefer is not matched to somebody else if candidate also prefers company C. The assignment also wants us to repeatedly test matchmaker algorithms to ensure they still produce stable matchings over many random inputs.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some tests to implement:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>check the hire pairs are bounded with the input
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>no hire(7,1) if input is only 3 companies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>check n companies and n candidates are in n pairs</li>
<li>check for duplicate matchings</li>
<li>check they are actually type Hire</li>
<li>check they are stable as per the algorithm in that book</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False matchmakers to try and fool your tests with:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>shuffle the pairs randomly</li>
<li>return a duplicate matching</li>
<li>return empty/n-1 or n + 1 pairs</li>
<li>swap companies w/candiates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
This was my good enough generate-input function for test inputs &lt; num = 25, more than that and needs optimization, like using a dict or keep a sorted accumulator to check for dupes.

<p>
First make a tree, run it, and type 'a-tree' into pyret interpreter and click the output to see the right and left branches, or a-tree.left or a-tree.right
</p>

<pre class="example">
a-tree =
  node(5,
    node(4, 
      node(3, mt, mt), mt),
    node(6, node(7, mt, mt), node(8, mt, mt)))

&gt;&gt; a-tree.left
node(4, node(3, mt, mt), mt)

&gt;&gt; a-tree.right
node(6, node(7, mt, mt), node(8, mt, mt))

&gt;&gt; a-tree.value
5
</pre>

<p>
The lab wants us to write various traversals, here's what I wrote for btree-in-order which is basically the other two orders as well, just rearrange helper(l) + root + helper(r):
</p>


<pre class="example">
data BTree&lt;T&gt;:
  | mt
  | node(value :: T, left :: BTree&lt;T&gt;, right :: BTree&lt;T&gt;)
end

a-tree =
  node(5,
    node(4, 
      node(3, mt, mt), mt),
    node(6, node(7, mt, mt), node(8, mt, mt)))

# degenerate tree from PAPL chapter 17.2.2
b-tree = node(1, mt,
  node(2, mt,
    node(3, mt,
      node(4, mt, mt))))

fun btree-in-order&lt;A&gt;(tree :: BTree&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;A&gt;:
  doc: "Returns the elements of tree in a list via an in-order traversal"

  fun helper(n :: BTree&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;A&gt;:
    cases (BTree) n:
      | mt =&gt; empty
      | node(v, l, r) =&gt;
        link(v, helper(l) + helper(r)) 
    end
  end

  cases (BTree) tree:
    | mt =&gt; empty
    | node(v, l, r) =&gt;
      helper(l) + link(v, empty) + helper(r)
  end
where:
  btree-in-order(a-tree) is [list: 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  btree-in-order(b-tree) is [list: 1, 2, 3, 4]
end
</pre>

<p>
Another lab where we rewrite map/filter/fold. Below when you see Prof K's lecture on knowledge transfer you'll understand why he makes us do this over and over. This is my first attempt at map, I wrote it like he writes software on the board in class thinking through the data definition:
</p>

<pre class="example">
data BTree&lt;T&gt;:
  | mt
  | node(value :: T, left :: BTree&lt;T&gt;, right :: BTree&lt;T&gt;)
end

a-tree =
  node(5,
    node(4, 
      node(3, mt, mt), mt),
    node(6, node(7, mt, mt), node(8, mt, mt)))

# degenerate tree from PAPL chapter 17.2.2
b-tree = node(1, mt,
  node(2, mt,
    node(3, mt,
      node(4, mt, mt))))

fun btree-map&lt;A, B&gt;(f :: (A -&gt; B), tree :: BTree&lt;A&gt;) -&gt; BTree&lt;B&gt;:
  doc: "Recursively applies f to the value of every node contained in tree"

  cases (BTree) tree:
    | mt =&gt; mt
    | node(v, l, r) =&gt;
      node(f(v), btree-map(f, l), btree-map(f, r))
  end
where:
  btree-map(lam(x): x + 1 end, a-tree) is node(6, node(5, node(4, mt, mt), mt), 
    node(7, node(8, mt, mt), node(9, mt, mt)))
  btree-map(lam(x): x + 1 end, b-tree) is node(2, mt, node(3, mt, node(4, mt, node(5, mt, mt))))
end

&gt;&gt;btree-map(lam(x): x * x end, a-tree)
node(25, node(16, node(9, mt, mt), mt), node(36, node(49, mt, mt), node(64, mt, mt)))

</pre>

<p>
Note that btree-fold the lab wants you to convert the tree to a list, apply f to every element and produce a value just like regular fold does with a warning about complete testing, meaning every function of regular fold should be replicated here.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org471e23e">
<p>
I interpret the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/filesystemfilesystem.html">assignment</a> to mean this directory tree/model:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# this is missing from my template:
type Path = List&lt;String&gt;

# you can omit size field, so c = file("name", "text") and c.size will return size 4 of the content field 'text'.  
filesystem = (dir("TS", [list:
        dir("Text", empty, [list: file("part1", 99, "content"), file("part2", 52, "content"), file("part3", 17, "content")]),   
        dir("Libs", [list: 
            dir("Code", empty, [list: file("hang", 8, "content"), file("draw", 2, "content")]), 
            dir("Docs", empty, [list: file("read!", 19, "content")])], empty)],
      [list: file("read!", 10, "content")]))
</pre>

<p>
Recall that Pyret allows you to write methods for datatype, here's an example for du-dir() where I wrote a .size() method you can call on any directory:
</p>

<pre class="example">
provide *
provide-types *

data File:
  | file(name :: String, size :: Number, content :: String)
end

data Dir:
  | dir(name :: String, ds :: List&lt;Dir&gt;, fs :: List&lt;File&gt;) with:
    method size(self :: Dir) -&gt; Number:
      doc: "Returns combined file size, file count, and sub directory count of a Dir"
      size(self)
    end
end

fun size(d :: Dir) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Method .size()"

  fun fsize(fd :: Dir) -&gt; Number:
    doc: "Returns file size, and number of files in a Dir"
    fd.fs.foldl(lam(f :: File, acc :: Number): 1 + f.size + acc end, 0)
  end

  fsize(d)
    + map(lam(x :: Dir): 1 + size(x) end, d.ds).foldl(lam(elt, acc): elt + acc end, 0)
end
check:
  a = dir("TS", [list:
      dir("Text", empty, [list: file("part1", 1, "content")])], empty)

  b = dir("Libs", [list: 
      dir("Code", empty, [list: file("hang", 1, "content"), file("draw", 1, "content")]), 
      dir("Docs", empty, [list: file("read!", 1, "content")])], empty)

  c = dir("TS", [list:
      dir("Text", empty, [list: file("part1", 1, "content"), file("part2", 1, "content"), file("part3", 1, "content")]),   
      dir("Libs", [list: 
          dir("Code", empty, [list: file("hang", 1, "content"), file("draw", 2, "content")]), 
          dir("Docs", empty, [list: file("read!", 1, "content")])], empty)],
    [list: file("read!", 1, "content")])

  d = dir("TS", [list:
      dir("Text", empty, [list: file("part1", 99, "content"), file("part2", 52, "content"), file("part3", 17, "content")]),   
      dir("Libs", [list: 
          dir("Code", empty, [list: file("hang", 8, "content"), file("draw", 2, "content")]), 
          dir("Docs", empty, [list: file("read!", 19, "content")])], empty)],
    [list: file("read!", 10, "content")])

  e = dir("TS", empty, [list: file("", 1, "")])

  a.size() is 3
  b.size() is 8
  c.size() is 19
  d.size() is 218
  e.size() is 2
end
</pre>

<p>
This is all in the Pyret documentation, and I looked at the Pyret source on github to see how to chain multiple methods:
</p>

<pre class="example">
data Dir:
  | dir(name :: String, ds :: List&lt;Dir&gt;, fs :: List&lt;File&gt;) with:
    method size(self :: Dir) -&gt; Number:
      doc: "Returns the size of all sub directories"
      size(self)
    end,
    method path(self :: Dir, s :: String) -&gt; List&lt;Path&gt;:
      doc: "Takes a Dir, and a search string, returns the path"
      path(self, s)
    end
end
</pre>

<p>
The path method there's numerous ways you could architect this to be better. I do these exercises on a phone whenever I have spare time (commuting, lunch break, randomly get an idea somewhere) and often repeated the same annoying mistake using [list: ] instead of 'empty' which seems to break everything in Pyret.

The chapter on streams will explain some calculus notation converting it to a pyret function. The symbol \(\varepsilon\) is epsilon which is a small positive qty, and "functions of arity one" means one parameter or input. There's a <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/A_Tour_of_Pyret.html#(part._.For_loops)">for loop</a> used in the check block which is an iterator. We learn more about the ( -&gt;) notation, meaning no arguments. 
</p>

<p>
The fibonacci example, change the starting values around so you can see what's going on. You first lz-link 0 and 1 then those values are mapped over, producing a new value, which gets mapped over again etc.

If you did the tree lab earlier this <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/updaterupdater.html">assignment</a> will be easy to prototype then gets harder as you try and optimize, like the writeup suggests make a working prototype first then optimize. Write your own datatype for Cursor&lt;A&gt;, for variants write a node index, the children/subtrees of that node, and another variant for everything else in the tree or 'above' the cursor. The Lists library has helpful built-ins such as get() and set() and filter to change the list of subtrees in mytree.children. The analysis they want was done in big-O lab 2, writing up a formal analysis describing the run-time complexity of each operation. Can you describe how your own code works and it's runtime complexity? That's all this is asking. 
</p>

<p>
Option <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/option.html">datatype</a> is explained in the Pyret documentation, used if a function may not return a value. Notice the cases on Option, some(a) returns value 'a' and none returns whatever value you want instead of nothing, like 0 or a string 'empty'.

Note the check blocks can have strings, so when you run a test you know which one failed such as check "if leaves are zero": &#x2026;test.. end. We discover this is a design pattern that allows abstracting out this pattern of carrying information and it's called monadic programming.

This method of writing a draft and throwing it out as you learn more about a program you want to write is explained in <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> vol 1. Go on <a href="http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=43B1AA61C839919E97EB1E5F68204C6E">libgen</a> and get any draft of the MMIX fascicle or Vol 1 copy, look at 1.4.1 (page 63 in the MMIX fascicle). Knuth talks about how you would go about writing 'a complex and lengthy program'. This is the Dijkstra method from <i>Structured Programming</i> in 1972. Nobody writes programs this way anymore, but it's still an interesting read. Note he sketches everything on paper, figuring out all the program logic and splitting it up into smaller and smaller pieces or helper functions. After the strategic part is done he starts writing the easiest subroutine first, up the chain, until he reaches a point where enough is known about the problem that everything can be scrapped and redesigned.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1450/lectures.html">CS145</a> their probability and statistics course. Look at the textbook used in 145, it's Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, which is also an <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/index.htm">Open Courseware</a> course or try the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/index.htm">scholar version</a> taught by Prof Tsitsiklis because it comes with all the recitations too.</li>
<li>CS22 is encouraged, looking at it's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0220/#section4-lectures">page</a> it uses MIT's Math for CS pdf, this <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/">whole course</a> is public.</li>
<li>CS1951t is their VR <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brown-vr-sw-review-2018/home">course</a>, it seems to use that wiki as their lecture notes if you want to hack around with virtual environments.</li>

<li><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs195y/2020/pages/lectures.html">CS195y</a> is a course for modeling the state of programs that manipulate memory to prove protocols obey desired properties. In the past you went through the <a href="https://softwareabstractions.org/">Alloy book</a> but I'm guessing since Alloy has such poor documentation they now use their own racket implementation of Alloy called <a href="https://github.com/tnelson/Forge/blob/master/forge/docs/basicForgeDocumentation.md">Forge</a>. If you notice all the zoom lectures from 3/13 until the end of the course are open to download so you can get a good overview of what SAT solving is, natural deduction, binary decision diagrams, etc.</li>

<li>CS1650 is their <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1650/">exploitation writing</a> course, focusing on binary code reuse meaning taking existing code and hijacking it's control-flow execution order to make it do what you want like injecting your own code. You run binary.exe and in memory is code who's order you can rearrange. The lectures are closed but most of this material is from <a href="http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/">this</a> workshop, and you can learn assembly and practice Return-Oriented Programming from CMU's 15-213 which has youtube or <a href="https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22&amp;maxResults=50">panopto</a> lectures. MIT also has a systems <a href="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2020/">security</a> course if you wanted to know how CPU timing attacks work or how an <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html">operating system</a> works.</li>

<li><a href="https://dlicata.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/teaching/fp-s20/lect.html">COMP212</a> not listed by Prof K but when combined with Robert Harper's book <i>Programming in Standard Ml</i> is probably the best course I've ever taken, esp if you throw in Robert Harper's PFPL book as you do both courses. It's like taking the datatypes you make in Pyret and giving them super powers to write very large and complicated software all by yourself. You will especially like functors, which is a way to grab a module (library) and map over specific parts of it so writing extremely generalized core code and then mapping over it with specific code. This was originally going to be the first course in this workshop but the lectures were too hard to find, then the pandemic hit and now we have lectures available.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org94ec73a">
<p>
We're going to try some competitive programming to learn algorithms similar to the math workshop where we will try Putnam problems to better learn math proofs. Competitive programming basically consists of being given a problem, a sample input and expected output, and constraints meaning if your program uses too many resources it will be rejected. You submit code to an 'online judge' which is a server that compiles and runs the code against secret test suites and we will need to manipulate standard libraries digging into how they work and finding ways to bypass resource limitations. 
</p>

<p>
As we do this we'll complete some real algorithm resources like 15-451 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org90df172">
<p>
Prof Shriram Krishnamurthi from CS019 gives a talk <a href="https://youtu.be/rM_E2IwlprY">here</a> about us, the students of these courses and how all of us are really bad at transfering the skills we've been taught. He uses an example from his CS1730 class (which uses PAPL) on giving them an unsolvable problem they can't recognize even through they've all had prior classes on decidability. He gives advice how to achieve transfer you can try yourself, such as spiral curricula. You learn the same things in different levels of complexity, in other words you iterate over your education numerous times to pick up things you may not really get the first time or to see concepts being transfered from abstract to concrete.

<h3 id="orge7f60bc">CP4 Book</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge7f60bc">
<p>
I'm going to work through the first volume of <a href="https://cpbook.net/">Competitive Programming 4</a> that is used in <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs3233.html#lessonplan">this</a> class, because it addresses all the concerns by Prof K in the above lecture he gave on transfering skills. In the book a concept is taught to you then explicitly this is transfered by working through a lot of curated problems they recommend on popular competitive programming sites. You get to see the concept in many different representations, which makes it different from every other competitive programming resource. I had to buy it as there isn't a digital copy available yet but version 1 is free on their site, and version 3 can be found on libgen. <a href="https://open.kattis.com/">Kattis</a> and other online judges are free which the book uses. We will use other resources not just this book so doesn't really matter what version you have. tl;dr you don't have to buy it.
